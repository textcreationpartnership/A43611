            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>'Tis a pretty Trade indeed, invented by the Pope and the Devil; delivering to Satan by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and delivering from Satan by <hi>Abſolution,</hi> but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money in the Caſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, you are Rich and I am Poor, <hi>What then?</hi> Do not take part with my great Adverſary the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> (whom I never offended but by telling Truth) becauſe he is rich, great and powerful; but (as the Wiſeman counſels you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.22.) <hi>Rob not the poor, becauſe he is poor: neither oppreſs the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the gate.</hi>

                  <p>The Church-doors in Popiſh Countries, and alſo the Chappel-doors in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, ſtand open <hi>all the day long,</hi> to let in, to the Altar, all thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Murder</hi> (of which (there are more than a good many) make a Trade, and their <hi>onely</hi> Livelihood and <hi>Vocation.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>But to ſee <hi>(as I have ſeen)</hi> what rejoycing there was by the Pariſh Prieſts, or the Monaſteries, (<hi>whoſe luck</hi> hapned to be <hi>best,</hi> and neareſt to the place where the Murder was committed) how they would <hi>Joy, Huzzah,</hi> and <hi>Hallou,</hi> (as) at a Prize—<hi>A Prize</hi>—</p>
                  <p>For if the Murderer have got 20 Doubloones (the common price for a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the Altar-keepers will be ſure to make him divide, ſhare and <hi>go Snips;</hi> And then—<hi>The Proudest He in</hi> Portugal, <hi>or</hi> Spain, <hi>or</hi> Italy, dare not touch the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer for three days together (the time allowed for his Eſcape) no, not the King himſelf can fetch him from Holy Church; for <hi>he alſo</hi> is afraid of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition-men.</p>

                  <p>And can we think, but that it is <hi>a hard world for ſome ſinners</hi> to be excluded the Church and Sacraments, by greater Villains than themſelves?

                  <p>But I wonder not at his Greatneſs and <hi>Monſtrous Eccleſiaſticalſhip:</hi> For when the Antichriſtian <hi>Clergy</hi> had once made the <hi>Silly-Bigotted World believe,</hi> that they, their Commiſſaries, Regiſters and Sumners, were the onely <hi>Buyers and Sellers in the Temple,</hi> and, What do you lack?

                  <p>Then, then, and <hi>not till then,</hi> they got the <hi>whipping-hand</hi> of the ſuperſtitious world; for he that has <hi>got a hank</hi> over other Mens Souls and Conſciences, their Bodies and Eſtates <hi>(conſequently)</hi> are, without diſpute, at his Service and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>And when a Prieſt can make a poor <hi>Lady believe,</hi> that he can damn her, or <hi>abſolve her,</hi> and has the Keys, and ſomething elſe under his Girdle, and can let her into <hi>(or ſhut her out from)</hi> the Church and Sacraments, ſo that ſhe will but ſhew him all her Secrets, and unboſome her ſelf in <hi>Auricular Confeſſion:</hi> (Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd thereunto ſuperſtitiouſly, and <hi>bug-bear'd</hi> by many lying Miracles <hi>(in the Legend)</hi> of many that dyed, and got as far as Heaven-gates, but were glad to return <hi>(a long and weary Journey)</hi> to earth again, to be confeſt by a Prieſt, <hi>before they could be let in,</hi> dying unſhriv'd or unhouſled) can ſuch a Prieſt (that has got the Lock and Key of a <hi>Ladies Cloſet and Secrets</hi>) have far to go before he come at her heart?</p>
                  <p>And I have therefore wondred, that the jealous <hi>Italians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> (that will not ſuffer any man (ſcarce a Brother) to ſee their Wives face) ſhould yet permit them to go to <hi>ſecret and auricular Confeſſion,</hi> to a young, <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unguelt</hi> piece of Sanctity! (I had almoſt ſaid, Hypocriſie!).</p>
                  <p>I could not but wonder ('till now of late) to find—St. <hi>Ambroſie, Ora pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> in the Popiſh Letany or Maſs? <hi>For what merit?</hi> Oh! <hi>Captain St. Ambroſe</hi> was the firſt <hi>Eccleſiaſtical-Hector,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual-Bravo,</hi> that in defiance of God and the King, durſt as malapartly, as barbarouſly and inſultingly, (ſome ſay) <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly ſhut</hi> the doors of the Church againſt his Prince and Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder, not admitting him to the Sacrament nor Divine Service, 'till the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſubmitted to the proud inſulting Prieſt, and promis'd <hi>(upon his knees)</hi> that for the future he <hi>would be rul'd;</hi> and ſo, he and the Prieſt became <hi>Friends again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I ſee St. <hi>James</hi> (the Author (the Papiſts ſay of their Liturgy and Maſs) though he was none of the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles,</hi> yet was a Biſhop and a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> too, if he could <hi>ſo early</hi> inſert (into the Churches Common-Prayer Book) ſtout <hi>Captain St. Ambroſe,</hi> and make him pray for himſelf and all <hi>Chriſten-Souls,</hi> 400 years before he was born.</p>
                  <p>Oh! the merit of ſome mens Eccleſiaſtical Inſolence!</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Captain Ambroſe</hi> was Canoniz'd and <hi>Sainted for ſhutting</hi> the Church-doors, and debarring a great Sinner from Divine Service and Sacraments, Will not the men <hi>of the ſame Leaven</hi> Anathematize me, for <hi>opening the Church-doors</hi> thus to Sinners, great Sinners, and ſmall Sinners, and ſhut me out?</p>
                  <p>But it is better far, <hi>to eat with Publicans and Sinners,</hi> (as our bleſſed Saviour did) than to partake with <hi>Scribes, Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> to whom he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Wo, Wo, Wo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I known School-Boys (taught in the Church, but better fed than taught) <hi>to barr out</hi> their Maſters (and be Maſters of Miſ-rule) upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

                  <p>But, <hi>if I come,</hi> I'le open the Church Doors again, and ſpread the Arms of Mercy wide open and outſtretched to as great a <hi>Latitude and Comprehenſion,</hi> (as our Bleſſed Saviour did) even to Publicans and Sinners, they ſhall <hi>eat with me;</hi> let the Hypocrites <hi>eat alone,</hi> and (as fitteſt) <hi>by themſelves,</hi> if they will not vouchſafe to eat with Sinners; let them cringe and bow, and face to the Left, <hi>to the Left—to the Eaſt</hi>—the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sinners, <hi>(look you)</hi> Sinners, though they deſpiſe Sinners ſo much, <hi>in nomine Domini,</hi> Sinners are the beſt Gryſt that comes to their Mills: If it were not for Sinners, the Bench <hi>(Eccleſiaſtical at leaſt)</hi> would not be <hi>ſo ſcarlet</hi> as it is; their Holineſſes might ſit alone, as well as a cold, if it were not for Sinners, and look <hi>as lean as an Eaſter-Offering.</hi>

                  <p>Look you, Sir, <hi>look you,</hi> (I am got into the Modern Rhetorical Phraze <hi>entail'd on ſome ſeats</hi> of Eloquence) can it be Juſtice (look you, my Lord) that I ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> becauſe they <hi>ſin,</hi> and I <hi>only</hi> wiſh and endeavour their amendment?</p>

                  <p>And muſt he not have a face of Braſs (look you) and a conſcience of Steel, my <hi>Lord,</hi> that ſhall vindicate that domineering (Popiſhly invented) Prelacy, which the Holy Scriptures, and our Bleſſed Redeemer condemns, making <hi>all his</hi> Diſciples <hi>Spiritual-Levellers?</hi> Luke 22. Whoſe Diſciples then are the Popiſh Prelates? that in defiance of Chriſt, will <hi>domineer over</hi> the Clergy, their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and vex them with Law-Suits, having great Intereſt, and great Power, and withal, <hi>Purſe-proud,</hi> to defend, in ſpight of Chriſt, that Antichriſtian Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Clergical Tyranny over their Brethren, calling it as the Pope <hi>(contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione adjecto)</hi> firſt call'd it, <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> or the Holy Rule; But how can that be Holy that the Holy Scriptures and the Holy Jeſus decries and condemns? and it was firſt Enacted and made a Law in <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Pope did what he liſt</hi> both with King and People.

                  <p>If you be for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and Spiritual Weapons, rather <hi>Draw upon</hi> the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Adultereſſes, the Extortioners, impudent Extortioners in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual-Courts, in Probates, Adminiſtrations, Viſitations, Ordinations, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Licences to Preach, Inſtitutions, Inductions, Procurations; and, if <hi>you have power to Anathematize</hi> and <hi>Curſe,</hi> Curſe the Curſers and Blaſphemers of the unparallel'd Age we live in.</p>
                  <p>In all the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.

                     <hi>Curſed is he that taketh a reward to ſlay an innocent perſon,</hi> Deut. 27.25.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, if men be for Curſing, they may have their belly full, in Curſes that are not <hi>money-matters,</hi> nor <hi>cauſeleſs,</hi> and therefore ſhall come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>For though the Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Yet the Curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked,</hi> Prov. 3.33.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>the Rubrick</hi> does bewail that we have not the godly Diſcipline of the Primitive-Church, where Sinners were puniſh't in this World (by delivering to Satan) for never any man in the New Teſtament eſcap't death when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had deliver'd them over, for the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh</hi> (<hi>that</hi> muſt be death) that the <hi>ſpirit might be ſaved</hi> in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>No, alas, alas! we cannot kill men with a word, as did St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon great and terrible occaſions to make an example of notorious Sinners.</p>
                  <p>The Pope therefore made the <hi>ſilly Bigot-Magiſtrate do,</hi> (what the Devil <hi>us'd to do</hi> in the Apoſtles times) in killing and burning Hereticks, and entituling the Magiſtrate to the <hi>blood and odium,</hi> as well as to the <hi>honour</hi> of being the <hi>ſurrogate of</hi> the Prieſts <hi>Revenge;</hi> the Magiſtrate had a happy employment on't; but he durſt do no other, leſt upon his contempt of Canons of Holy-Church, <hi>Holy-Church</hi> had ſerv'd him with the ſame ſawce.</p>
                  <p>In my Travels, in Popiſh Countries, as <hi>Portugal, Spain,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Who,</hi> well knowing <hi>the way to the Wood,</hi> and that to be <hi>led gently by the noſe</hi> by thoſe Lay-Doctors, is the <hi>ſhorteſt cut</hi> to Preferment, and to be an eaſie Soul, or a tame Property, is a meritorious qualification in a Candidate for the Holy See; it would make a man ſmile (if it were lawful to <hi>ſmile on ſo ſad</hi> an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) to ſee an <hi>old Nidget</hi> put on his Spectacles to write his Name <hi>under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> for burning a Heretick, which the Lay-Chancellors, and Officials bring to him ready <hi>for his Wiſdom's Subſcription;</hi> though (poor <hi>old heart!</hi>) he knew nothing of the matter, nor heard one Witneſs <hi>viva voce</hi> in the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Nay, they would be very angry, if he makes the leaſt ſcruple or heſitation, or enquiry; <hi>What?</hi> not truſt his Delegates? his Lay-Vicars? not truſt publick Notaries and Proctors?

                  <p>Your under Officers? Why? they are the ſort of men of <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> that hitherto have ſeem'd to Cite me, upon pretended Articles of Barretry (of which neither you nor they are competent Judges; but you run the hazard <hi>(all of you)</hi> of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> if you take upon you to hale matters into your Courts that belong only to the Juriſdiction of the Courts of <hi>our Lord the King</hi>) as if they deſign'd only under colour of a Proceſs, to get me in amongſt them to affront, abuſe me, ſqueeze and cruſh me; they have done their utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>do what you will,</hi> I will never again appear at <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> in your Court, except you will ſecure me from affronts, and keep the Peace, that you will be perſonally preſent there, and hear my defence, and be <hi>an ear-witneſs,</hi> as well as a Judg, how I'le baffle them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leave me to your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Officers?</hi> Are you in Earneſt? have a care your under Officers, in meditating their Revenge on me, hit not you home, by bringing you within the Statutes of <hi>Proviſors,</hi> and <hi>Praemunire;</hi> if you with implicite faith truſt to them, they are in a fair way to't. But no Subject, how high ſo ever, is too great for the <hi>Law, and Truth:</hi> they muſt, they muſt, (read all Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,) they <hi>always did</hi> buckle, and ſubmit their ſturdy necks to the <hi>Law,</hi> or the Block.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52560:5"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Leave me to your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Officers?</hi> Do you ſay ſo ſtill? God defend: No, Sir, no, leave me not in the hands of mine Enemies, and give me not over to the will of mine Enemies, that hate me without a cauſe, without good cauſe, and <hi>only for telling truth</hi> of their vile Extortions, and viler Merchandize of precious Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leave me to your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Officers?</hi> nay, then I am well help't up; I am like to have a hopeful time on't: Why? theſe men of <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> as you'l ſee hereafter in <hi>this little Book,</hi> they are fleſh't upon me already, upon my Soul, and upon my Purſe too; Leave me to them? and they'l bring you a Sentence for you to ſuſpend me, ſtop my mouth, ſilence me, or, perhaps Excommunicate me; but throw <hi>away your Pen</hi> when you come to ſubſcribe it: let me adviſe you for once, truſt them not with a <hi>power Legantine;</hi> what care they what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience they bring upon you or the Church? they ſhoot ſecurely under the covert of your great Name and Authority, whilſt your <hi>Delegates</hi> do indeed by ſuch Proxy Sentence <hi>but make</hi> you a <hi>Surrogate</hi> of their private ſpleen, malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; you cannot have <hi>a worſe employment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that you and many others that <hi>do not know me,</hi> will wonder both at <hi>what</hi> I have written, and <hi>that</hi> I (durſt) write what follows; but 'tis <hi>becauſe they do not know me,</hi> for thoſe that do, will wonder at neither. Common-talk or <hi>fame</hi> is ſeldom a good <hi>Limner,</hi> or Pourtrays any man true; beſides, it is ſo various too, <hi>(now)</hi> as of old, ſome ſaid he was a <hi>good man,</hi> others ſaid, nay, <hi>but he deceiveth the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My own Cauſe in your Court (you'll ſee) needs <hi>not ten</hi> Lines to anſwer all; no, but I take willingly the occaſion here given to ſearch into your myſteries: for, how can I, or any honeſt <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> or Chriſtian, ſit unconcern'd, when we view ſuch <hi>havock made of Chriſtian Souls?</hi> bought and ſold, ſent to Satan, and thence redeem'd, but not without Money, Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fye upon't, Fye upon't,</hi> 'tis a burning ſhame it ſhould be ſuffered; 'tis againſt Conſcience, Reaſon, Law, Equity and Religion. And ſhall theſe fellows (bold and old in ſin) be cheriſh't, and I accounted too bold to tell them of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? And ſhall they have more of your countenance than I? <hi>do your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> But you ought not to judg <hi>re inaudita,</hi> and hearing but of one ear, reſerve but one for me, unſtufft with prejudice, and if you had never ſo lawful a Court, I neither need nor require a greater or <hi>other favour</hi> from you, whilſt I live: But to leave me to them? <hi>you ſhall not</hi> leave me to them; I'le waſh my hands of them, God bleſs me from them: I tell you here, <hi>I'le not come</hi> at them.</p>
                  <p>And I would have told you ſo at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> but I dare not come <hi>there neither,</hi> without your Order and Permiſſion; and when I writ to you, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (I ſent) ask't you, If you would have me to attend you? you ſaid, No, you left <hi>all to your under Officers;</hi> ſo that I have no other way but this publick way to approach your hand or ear: which is, I hope, a ſufficient Apology for this <hi>Humble Addreſs,</hi> of which I truſt you will not be an <hi>Abhorrer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil-Civilians</hi> that make Markets of Souls, do but <hi>(I know)</hi> truckle under the Clergy for a Livelihood; yet they are as petulant to the Clergy, as if they were only their Sport or <hi>May-game,</hi> or poor tame Aſſes, fit for nothing ſo much, as to be the <hi>Objects</hi> of their Wrath, and the <hi>Subjects</hi> of their Affronts and Scorn.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I known wanton Jades kick the Hand that fed them, and made them fat, nay, and throw their Maſters too, when <hi>Provant prick't them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Propheſie (tho') that I have taken off the <hi>keen edge</hi> of their onely <hi>Toole,</hi> theſe Eccleſiaſtical Fellows <hi>work</hi> (for money) <hi>with, viz.</hi> Excommunication, with a poor Formality-Prieſt ſtanding Surrogating in black, like—at their right hand, to ſee Livery and Seizin given of the Excommunicate Perſon that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Satan, they ſhall fight hereafter, but <hi>with rebated Weapons,</hi> they are ſo cruel in their Fulminations, and for ſuch Trifles too.</p>
                  <p>That ever a Kingdom of Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>ſo long bewitch'd to believe,</hi> that any can damn them, or forgive ſins, <hi>ſave God onely;</hi> or, that any man has power on earth given him from God, to <hi>keep</hi> others <hi>from</hi> the Ordinances, the means of
<pb facs="tcp:52560:6"/>Grace, the Sacraments, the Food of Souls, and the Bread of Life, <hi>becauſe they are Sinners; Sinners?</hi> Why there ſhould need no Ordinances, nor Sacraments, if it were not for Sinners; nor did ever any man receive the bleſſed Sacrament, but <hi>Sinners all,</hi> except our Saviour onely.</p>
                  <p>The Soul is ſick, 'tis granted, more need of Phyſick and Food: <hi>The whole have no need of a Phyſician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, the firſt that ever partook of the Bleſſed Supper, if they were <hi>Penitents,</hi> they were ſoon <hi>relaps't:</hi> For in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. in the 20th <hi>Verſe, they took it,</hi> and in the 24th <hi>Verſe,</hi> they were no ſooner come out from the Holy Feaſt, but they <hi>fell a quarrelling</hi> and juſtling for the place, and ſtriving <hi>(it runs in the kind perhaps)</hi> which of them ſhould be the greateſt.</p>
                  <p>But the crafty Popiſh Prieſts finding that Sinners <hi>found the goodneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Bleſſed Sacrament, and <hi>long'd</hi> for it, and <hi>they</hi> were the <hi>onely Stewards</hi> of thoſe Myſteries, they reſolved to make the beſt benefit of the <hi>Stewards place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed I have obſerv'd, in ſome Countries, where I have been, that when (once) the <hi>Clergy</hi> have perceiv'd that their Office was found ſo mighty <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> they reſolve to take the occaſion, and make their <hi>best advantage</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Did the People find comfort in the Bread of Life, and alſo were made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that none could Conſecrate it but a Prieſt, or Popiſh Prieſt: Ay, (quoth the Popiſh Prieſt) <hi>Sinner, Do you ſee?</hi> Do you ſee here what I have got in my hands? Would you not be glad to have ſome? Nay, <hi>Hold—Stand off</hi>—Here is the Bread of Life, but <hi>not a Bit upon a march,</hi> not a Bit upon the great march and High-way to Heaven, though it would <hi>ſave your Soul,</hi> except you be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to your Dioceſan, nay, and ſwear Obedience to Canons and Laws of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church though you ſtarve and dye for a Bit.</p>
                  <p>He therefore that can make a Sacrament, and debarr <hi>(ad libitum)</hi> ſinners from it, may well <hi>take the wall</hi> of all other Men in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is no Scripture in the Old or New Teſtament (that ever I found) that ever gave power to any Man, Men, or Church, <hi>to debar any Man from the Sacraments,</hi> that is pleaſed to come to them; for ſuch as were deliver'd to Satan in the Apoſtles days, were <hi>therewith kill'd,</hi> their Fleſh was deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, an impenitent Sinner <hi>he comes at his own peril,</hi> if he venture to eat <hi>unworthily;</hi> but 'tis not a greater ſin to eat unworthily, than <hi>not to eat</hi> at all; rejecting of the Ordinance is certain damnation, whereas he that eats unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, makes a hopeful Aſſay of Obedience to Chriſt; and as he ſaid, <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> ſo it is acceptable worthineſs, to ſay, <hi>Lord, I endeavor to eat and drink worthily, help my unworthineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo he that prays, preaches, or hears unworthily, preaches, hears and prays damnation to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor, need I tell you my Lord, that the world is generally miſtaken in the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And this Conſtruction of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>We are all Sinners, and the Sacrament's made on purpoſe <hi>for us,</hi> and none but thoſe that have the gift of God <hi>of diſcerning of ſpirits</hi> infallibly by the Holy Ghoſt (as the Primitive Chriſtians had) can judge of the <hi>truth</hi> of any mans <hi>Repentance,</hi> or conſequently ſetch power from the Scriptures to debar men from the holy Ordinances, or ſhut the Church-doors againſt them.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52560:6"/>
                  <p> I know, <hi>Prieſts have made a gainful Trade on't,</hi> but, abating that, By what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Divine</hi> do they theſe things, and who gave them that Authority, (I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways except the Rubrick in the Common-Prayer Book?)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacramenta non ſunt Vaenalia,</hi> Sacraments are too holy to be made <hi>Vendible Commodities;</hi> And if my Child ſhall not be baptiz'd, 'till I have compounded with the Prieſt, whoſe Religion is—No <hi>Penny,</hi> No <hi>Pater-noſter;</hi> Nor if I muſt not come into the Church, but <hi>be barr'd out,</hi> 'till I have <hi>pleas'd,</hi> that is, <hi>paid</hi> the Sumner, the Regiſter, the Proctor, and the Court-Fees, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know many People think <hi>'tis a hard world</hi> ſince the Inquiſition and High-Commiſſion-Court were diſſolved, now that <hi>Curſt Cows have ſhort Horns;</hi> yet let them comfort themſelves with Excommunication, and the Writ <hi>de Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato Capiendo;</hi> for though the Writ <hi>de Heretico comburendo</hi> be burnt, and we <hi>cannot burn an Heretick</hi> for our Lives, yet the Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo</hi> ſhall impriſon the Heretick, and <hi>bury him alive</hi> in a Jayl, and <hi>what would men have?</hi> Methinks that ſhould content them, <hi>Enough, Enough in all Conſcience,</hi> a man would think, if they have any Conſcience in them.

                  <p>Time was—<hi>Ay, Ay, Time was,</hi> when a bold Fellow that durſt ſpeak the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-Truth,</hi> or, tell Rich men of their Roguery, he had as good have <hi>eat his Ears</hi> in the <hi>merry days</hi> of the Inquiſition and High-Commiſſion, But who can help <hi>the thing that will away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I daily expect the Effects of the Fury and Rage of the Devil, and deviliſh men, that rage ſo much the more, as foreſeeing <hi>their time is ſhort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (bleſſed be God) my ſhoulders are as big and large <hi>(of the largeſt ſize)</hi> as the moſt of Mortals, and can bear as much; I doubt not but they'll <hi>try my ſtrength:</hi> A whole Legion of <hi>Sell-Souls</hi> will fall upon me for this little Book, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make one Back crack, than not load the Wretch that takes away the Trade of the <hi>Higlers</hi> and <hi>Retailers</hi> of Heaven and Hell, by which they have liv'd ſo long and ſo plentifully.</p>

                  <p>No, no, Biſhop <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was not aſham'd of his poor Kinſmen and Relations ſpiritual, as high and ſtout as he was; and ſcorn'd to Try them, Judge them, much leſs Curſe them, Silence them, Stop their Mouths, and Excommunicate them by <hi>Proxy,</hi> or by <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet he was a great Eccleſiaſtical Judge, as well as your Lordſhip; not a Judge at or of Common-Law, Statute-Law, the Municipal-Law, but a Judge by and according to <hi>Canon-Law.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Canon-Law?</hi> Ay, if any Body can or does Judge by it this day: Canon-Law,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> four or five great Folio's of it, too bulky to get well into any man's head, that is already ſtufft full of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Canon-Law?</hi> 'Tis as eaſie to make a Rope of Sand, as to make the Canon-Law agree with its ſelf: one Canon and one Council does ſo thwart and thwack one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> in which whoſoever is vers't, ſhall find enough to fit almoſt any purpoſe; Had we not as good keep to the <hi>Canon of Holy Scripture?</hi> as to be led (to Sentence) by <hi>Proxy,</hi> and <hi>Lay-Doctors</hi> of Canon-Law, even juſt as they ſhall <hi>nuzzle things</hi> into our heads.</p>
                  <p>But give me leave to mind you of one Canon-Law more, moſt agreeable to our Engliſh Laws: Concil. Carthag. 4. Can. 22, 23, 29, 30, 32. <hi>Epiſcopus ſi Clerico vel Laico crimen impoſuerit, deducatur ad probationem in Synodum;</hi> &amp; Can. 30. <hi>Caveant Judices Eccleſiae ne abſente eo cujus cauſa ventilatur, ſententiam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferant, quia irrita erit, imo &amp; cauſam in Synodo pro facto dabunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Eccleſiaſtical Judges have a care <hi>and look to</hi> that they pronounce no Sentence in the abſence of the Party accus'd, nor without conſent of a Synod of Presbyters; if otherwiſe, it ſhall be null and void, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Beſides, a Coxcomb knows not how to write of ſuch <hi>deep and high,</hi> dark and myſterious points of Divinity, Law and Policy; and <hi>none but a Coxcomb (ſay others)</hi> will ſpeak Truth in this lying, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fawning, diſſembling, perfidious and treacherous Age.</p>
                  <p>So that if I diſcuſs theſe Arguments never ſo well and warily, yet <hi>if I ſpeak out,</hi> plain and home (there's Piety in't indeed, but) where's the Wiſdom and the Policy of it? ſays Sir <hi>Politick Would-be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, therefore, as for the <hi>Naked-Tiuth-men,</hi> tear them, rend them, fleece them, ſhear them, hire <hi>Thompſon</hi> and the <hi>Be-Jeſuited Heraclitus</hi> to Libel them, bely and ſlander them all the Kingdom over, hire ſome <hi>Welſh-Taffee,</hi> of a <hi>Hackney-Tongue</hi> and <hi>Proſtituted Conſcience,</hi> with broad ſtaring eyes brim-full of Pride, Self-conceit and Fury, in all Companies, on all Occaſions to <hi>beſpatter</hi> them, <hi>Trepan</hi> them, <hi>Teague</hi> them, <hi>Taffee</hi> them, and <hi>Man-catch them;</hi> nay, (if they cannot be <hi>Godfreydiz'd</hi> nor <hi>Arnoldiz'd,</hi> yet) if you can <hi>hang them</hi> out of the way, What ſhould they do living here? Make an Example of ſuch fellows as have ſo little wit as to ſpeak plain Truths in an Age of Hypocriſie. Did you never ſee a <hi>Crow</hi> or <hi>Magottepye</hi> ſit <hi>pecking,</hi> and <hi>cawing, crowing</hi> and <hi>chattering</hi> upon an Aſſes back, or a Swines back? Why? theſe tame creatures are born for affronts: However, if they be rich, uſe all Arts and Stratagems (imaginable) to beggar them, that, <hi>Truth</hi> (if it will live and walk) may yet walk only <hi>the length of a Jayl,</hi> and in a Threadbare-Coat.</p>

                  <p>If any man think my ſtyle too Jocular and Airy for the <hi>gravity</hi> of a Divine, and ſo grave a Subject; let ſuch buſie Cenſurers uſe their own <hi>Lumpiſh Dumpiſh</hi> grave way, and <hi>lull</hi> themſelves and their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>aſleep,</hi> and ſo get applauſe beyond the fame of <hi>Opium:</hi> whil'ſt this facetious (I was going to ſay this <hi>Eraſmus his</hi>) way of writing, catches the Reader gently, and inſenſibly, making him a <hi>Captive Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer,</hi> and (once entred) he knows not how to deſiſt, though call'd away by buſineſs, hunger or ſleep.

Yet not to vapour too much of my <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (<hi>the Naked Truth</hi> on't) what if the publick-weal be gratified by any thing here writ, not I (but the men of <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi>) merit the thanks.</p>
                  <p>For I am (by my temper, complexion, choice and inclination) of a <hi>retir'd Genius,</hi> I hate the crowd, a noiſe, a ſtage, or to be poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, or to appear in publick (but eſpecially) in Print: though (thank my fate) it falls out otherwiſe of late, and contrary to my <hi>beloved obſcurity.</hi>

                  <p>The beſt on't was, I was not ſo ſoon Thunderſtrook with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication for <hi>a Nonne-no,</hi> but I was ſooner Abſolv'd, namely, within half an hour (and leſs) after I firſt heard of it, but not without <hi>delivering my Purſe;</hi> for the delivering to Satan by <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> together with the delivery from Satan by <hi>Abſolution</hi> in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors-Commons,</hi> coſt me a <hi>Guiney</hi> (not to diſſemble the matter) neither more nor leſs; I believe I ſhall love a <hi>Guiney</hi> for this trick (if it be but for this vertue inherent in it) the better as long as I live.</p>
                  <p>Old Poets tell a Tale of <hi>Charon</hi> the Ferry-man of Hell, that wafts men thither over the diſmal River <hi>Styx,</hi> but he makes them pay <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> a <hi>Naubum,</hi> in <hi>Scotch</hi> money <hi>Sex pennies,</hi> or a <hi>Baubee,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> two farthings for fraight; but what they paid for being <hi>Sculler'd back</hi> again, is not in the <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> (I ſuppoſe) becauſe 'tis needleſs, for <hi>Charon</hi>'s-<hi>boat</hi> is always <hi>empty</hi> of Paſſengers <hi>back</hi> again.

                  <p>But I tell you a <hi>real Truth,</hi> and that every man knows to be true, the <hi>Trade</hi> is <hi>currant</hi> and <hi>ſetled</hi> long ago (firſt) by the <hi>Pope</hi> betwixt himſelf and the Devil, and a brisk Trade (there has been) between the Devil and him, though of late ſomewhat decay'd; and the price of Souls to the Devil, and Hell and back again, is much lower'd of late days (though three hundred times better, and more advanc'd than what it was in <hi>Charon</hi>'s time; for the <hi>Pope</hi> (I ſay <hi>really and truly</hi> without a Fiction, I know it <hi>to my coſt</hi> to be true) made himſelf the real <hi>Ferry-man</hi> of Hell, and though <hi>he</hi> did not carry Souls thither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>himſelf,</hi> as did his Predeceſſor <hi>Charon,</hi> yet he ſent them thither by his <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> for nothing; but never ſuffered any man to be <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Satan, or abſolv'd,</hi> but he made him then <hi>pay</hi> for his Journey <hi>thither</hi> by Excommunication, before ever he would ſuffer them to <hi>return</hi> by Abſolution: and as bad as trading goes (for the <hi>Naked-Truth</hi> has almoſt quite ſpoil'd it; yet) it is <hi>to this day</hi> abſolutely the <hi>(beſt Trade)</hi> (I was going to ſay, <hi>(but that's a lie)</hi> but it is <hi>ſtill</hi> the) <hi>moſt gainful Trade</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> for you run no hazard, but of the <hi>firſt waftage</hi> to Satan, and even then alſo, if ever they be <hi>ſuffered</hi> to return, they pay ſauce, they <hi>pay for all</hi> at <hi>laſt;</hi> beſides, a man runs no great hazard in ſtock, for a ſmall ſtock will ſet a man up, a little <hi>Wax</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> and <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> (except the place might coſt ſomewhat at the entrance and admittance for a <hi>Garſome</hi> or <hi>Fine,</hi> but however) the Trade begins to <hi>brisk up</hi> again, and ſometimes they ſhall make you, of one particular Soul, (eſpecially if it be a <hi>Churchwarden's Soul</hi>) ten or twenty waftages; and for <hi>every waftage</hi> ſeven or eight pound, if it be a <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> Soul, and <hi>long upon the Road</hi> or <hi>Voyage,</hi> for they go both by Land and Water; and of a <hi>poor</hi> Soul, and <hi>quick paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Well! 'tis no <hi>laughing matter,</hi> (Gentlemen) <hi>Proximus ardet,</hi> it may be <hi>your own</hi> turns in good time; there's no body has cauſe to laugh that I know but the Pope, and ſuch as he firſt conſtituted Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Apparitor's, Surrogates, <hi>&amp;c. they</hi> indeed <hi>may</hi> well <hi>laugh, they win.</hi>

                  <p>There are two Books of <hi>Naked-Truth</hi> (I ought to tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the third Part, and fourth Part, that are <hi>father'd</hi> upon me, but they are <hi>ſpurious,</hi> and <hi>unlike me</hi> or my ſtyle; which is <hi>uniform</hi> (at <hi>worſt</hi>) and ſome ſay ſo <hi>ſingular,</hi> that I need not put my name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, 'tis <hi>ſelf-evident,</hi> I never writ <hi>more Naked-Truths</hi> than <hi>This,</hi> and the <hi>Second Part of Naked-Truth;</hi> and the <hi>Vindication</hi> thereof againſt <hi>Fullwood.</hi>

                  <p>Nor had I writ <hi>this</hi> but upon the ſaid occaſion, nor <hi>troubled my ſelf</hi> or the <hi>World</hi> with my Notions, if I had not been troubled in their <hi>Spiritual-Courts;</hi> for I love my <hi>retiredneſs,</hi> having been <hi>cloy'd</hi> with the <hi>Flouriſh</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the World before I choſe to ſettle my ſelf in an <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>dormant Function,</hi> in being a Prieſt: In which ſilence I had for ever (as my deſire was) lain hid, but Providence will have it otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after two or three experiments, I think men are mad, <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt</hi> or <hi>bewitch'd,</hi> to trouble me, or trouble themſelves with me, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to inſtigate and provoke a man that <hi>ſtudies to be quiet;</hi> if the <hi>Devil did not owe them</hi> a ſhame.</p>
                  <p>The Reader cannot reaſonably expect <hi>that accuracy</hi> of method, or <hi>ſpruce ſtyle</hi> in <hi>ſo haſty</hi> a Birth, Conceiv'd and Digeſted long ago, but writ every word in that <hi>Weeks ſtay</hi> I made at <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>throng</hi> of other buſineſſes; and far from <hi>my Study, my Notes</hi> and <hi>my Books.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the moſt <hi>tough</hi> and <hi>ſinewy</hi> Arguments are then moſt effectual, when made <hi>pliable</hi> to the capacity, and finely <hi>fitted to the head;</hi> which the ſaid two great names ('tis rare, <hi>two in one Age</hi>) had <hi>got the knack</hi> of; nor were any of their time <hi>more belov'd</hi> by ſome, or <hi>more hated</hi> by others:</p>

                  <p>However, the Town of his Nativity, <hi>(Roterdam)</hi> (as the ſeven <hi>Iſlands-Mediterranean</hi> contended for the Honour of being the <hi>Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi>) in eternal memory of his Immortal Name, have ſet up his <hi>Effigies</hi> in <hi>Braſs,</hi> in their chief Church, (as I am informed) ſtyling him for their own Honour, as well as his, <hi>Eraſmus Roterdamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no man ever (yet) writ <hi>ſo well</hi> (ſince the Chriſtian World (was and is) ſo divided into factions) as to get every bodies good word, no, not our bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf; ſome ſaid true of him, as <hi>Peter, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God;</hi> and others lyed, and ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a Devil.</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>theſe Delinquents</hi> (the Fools and the Knaves) are by far the <hi>major part</hi> of the World, and therefore 'tis reputation enough (and to be ſure the moſt laſting, and the way to be everlaſting) if men be but acceptable to <hi>the few honeſt and wiſe;</hi> who ſhall <hi>eternize</hi> the memory, for fools bolts are <hi>not ſooner ſhot</hi> than <hi>vaniſht,</hi> and the envy of knaves expires and ceaſes, and is <hi>buried</hi> with, and <hi>in the Grave</hi> of the Worthy.</p>

                     <p>THis <hi>being Premiſed,</hi> I will begin with the firſt <hi>Query.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Query 1. <hi>Whether</hi> Chriſt or his Apoſtles <hi>ever made ſuch an Ordinance as Excommunication? And whether</hi> like to that <hi>in uſe at this day?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Firſt, None can imagin that our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> the <hi>Restorer of breaches,</hi> that was <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>lowlineſs</hi> it ſelf, ſhould give <hi>many eager</hi> or frequent commands to extirpate or diſmember any of his Body; for he came to <hi>ſeek and to ſave</hi> that which was loſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we meet but <hi>with one place</hi> in all the Goſpel that gives any colour to Excommunication; namely, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17, 18.</p>
                     <p>But our Saviour (after all the caution imaginable of a <hi>mild and private previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> proceeding and dealing tenderly with a Brother, a <hi>Jew,</hi> (that <hi>treſpaſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, thee</hi>) betwixt <hi>thee and him;</hi> (which if it took effect, the <hi>cauſe was ſtopt,</hi> and all further proceedings, it went no further;) but when the <hi>method of cure</hi> prov'd ineffectual, The next remedy was (not to <hi>put him into the Court, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him,</hi> but) to take with thee <hi>one or two more;</hi> to which, if the Treſpaſſer would hearken, (though he had neglected and <hi>refuſed at the firſt private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> yet) <hi>there alſo all proceedings were ſtopt,</hi> and the matter privately huſht up, to avoid ſcandal; and the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Spiritual-Court</hi> never heard a word of it, except theſe Preſcriptions of our Saviour did <hi>not effect</hi> the Cure.</p>
                     <p>And then, (and <hi>not till then</hi>) by any warrant from the Goſpel, was any man to be <hi>put into the Court,</hi> or <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or, the matter told <hi>to the Church,</hi> or made a publick buſineſs of.</p>
                     <p>But then if the Criminal neglected to <hi>hear the Church,</hi> What then? Does he command the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>deliver him</hi> to <hi>Satan?</hi> He only ſays—Let him be unto thee as <hi>an Heathen-man and a Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52560:11"/>
                     <p> Which words can have no other Grammatical Conſtruction, but that thou ſhouldſt look upon him as a man that <hi>regards not the precepts</hi> and <hi>admonitions</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim,</hi> more than does <hi>a Heathen-man</hi> or <hi>a Publican,</hi> that never pretended to be <hi>ſubject</hi> to them, nor <hi>Subject</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou mayſt take thy courſe at Law with him, and bring a <hi>Clauſum Fregit,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> againſt him, before the <hi>Roman-Magiſtrates,</hi> in their Courts of Judicatory, as you may againſt a <hi>Heathen-man,</hi> (that is, a <hi>Gentile</hi>) or a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Publicans</hi> (though many of thoſe <hi>Exciſe-men, Toll-gatherers,</hi> or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-gatherers</hi> were <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> too, and ſome of them <hi>Jewiſh Chriſtians,</hi> yet they) were <hi>Herodians,</hi> (that is) true <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoke</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and therefore odious to the Puritanical Eygots (the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical <hi>Phariſees</hi>) that lookt <hi>with ſcorn</hi> upon all Man-kind (and as <hi>Dogs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd and hated all) if they were not of their Religion, or rather <hi>fooliſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beſt Comment upon Holy-Scripture is its ſelf, and the beſt Interpreter of our Bleſſed Saviour's ſayings, are his own and his Apoſtles Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>A like Saying to this (of <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17.) we have in <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3, 4. where our Saviour ſays, <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee, if he repent, forgive him;</hi> (that is) if he pay the Treſpaſs, and make thee ſatisfaction, and confeſs his fault, and be ſorry for it, and promiſe amendment, (for without theſe there is no true Repentance) then forgive him ſeven times, and ſeventy ſeven times, even as often as he ſhall ſin againſt thee; and neither Court him, nor Sue him in the Spiritual-Court, (before the Sanhedrim or High-Prieſts-Court) nor yet in the Temporal Courts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Heathen-men</hi> and <hi>Publicans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For our Bleſſed Saviour does not ſay, Let him be to the Church as a Heathen-man or a Publican, which the Pope to colour the Authority and <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of his Excommunications (as he does that of Chriſt to <hi>Peter—Thou art</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church</hi>) does without any ground or colour (as politickly as ſenceleſly) Conſtrue and Interpret.</p>
                     <p>But our Bleſſed Saviour only ſays, <hi>Let him be to thee, (to thee, not</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi>) as a <hi>Heathen-man</hi> or a <hi>Publican:</hi> (that is) thou mayſt lawfully then Sue thy Brother <hi>Jew</hi> at Law, as well as any <hi>Gentile,</hi> or <hi>Heathen-man,</hi> or <hi>Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor did ever any ſolid Scholar or Divine (that was not prejudic'd and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd in his Judgment, which is uſually the ſame with that of their Mothers and Catechiſers, for few men have wit enough to ſee and chuſe their own way, and know why and wherefore,) following (like Horſes in a Teame) with Noſe in Tayl of their Predeceſſors, I ſay,) never an unbyaſs't man that ever I yet met with, could prove Excommunication out of <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. But what may be concluded from the next, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. ſhall be examin'd by and by.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. <hi>(to my underſtanding)</hi> ſounds much like that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Dare any of you, having a matter againſt another, go to Law before the unjuſt, and not before the Saints? Do ye not know (that the Saints ſhall judg the world? and if the world ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judg the ſmalleſt matters?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Know ye not that we ſhall judg Angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If then ye have judgment of things pertaining to this life, ſet them to judg who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church, I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is it ſo that there is not a wiſe man amongſt you? no not one that ſhall be able to judg between his brethren?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the unbelievers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now therefore there is utterly a fault amongſt you, becauſe you go to Law one with another: Why do ye not rather ſuffer wrong? Why do ye not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that when Jews or Chriſtians happen to live in ſubjection under a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, or Heathen-Government, than that of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52560:12"/>this of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. is a Rule for them to walk by, as to going to Law.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Romans</hi> had not Conquer'd and given Laws to the Jews (as they did in our Saviour's time) and alſo if Chriſtians do not live under a Heathen-Government, then <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. has no place, nor is there any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thoſe Rules, but they are Rules only in ſuch caſes; nor is it heard of in an Age (I know it, that have liv'd amongſt the Jews) that the Jews go to Law one with another before the Chriſtians, or put them into a Court-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or Court-Mahometan.</p>
                     <p>But in a Kingdom or Country where the chief Magiſtrates are Chriſtians or Jews, there is no place nor occaſion for this Rule; namely, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen-man or a Publican:</hi> And therefore this Text is nothing to prove, or colour Excommunication at this day, nor ever was in our Saviour's time; 'tis nothing to the purpoſe, but a fooliſh Popiſh groundleſs Comment.</p>
                     <p>But as this Comment aroſe from Popiſh Politicks and Prelatical Uſurpation, ſo it was grounded, and is yet countenanced, by and from a vulgar error;</p>
                     <p>Namely, That the Synagogue or Sanhedrim amongſt the Jews, was only a Spiritual-Court, or Kirk-Adminiſtration; and that all the weapons they had, was putting out of the Synagogue, or debarring and excluding from the Sacraments, Ordinances, Divine-Service, and all Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical-Communion: And not one of a thouſand at this day but ſo accept it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas in truth, the Sanhedrim, Kirk, or Synagogue, was no more a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eccleſiaſtical Court, than thoſe amongſt us in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or at the Aſſizes: For the Sanhedrim or Synagogue acted by a ſtanding Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> there was not amongſt the Jews (eſpecially in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours time, when he ſpoke thoſe words, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17.) two diſtinct Juriſdictions, Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal, one for the Soul, another for the Body: (for ſuch differen Courts are apt to claſh, and keep a quarrelling, or ado, with Prohibitions, Conſultations, and I know not what.)</p>
                     <p>But the Lord-Chief-Juſtice was alſo High-Prieſt and Chief Magiſtrate: and all the Inferiour Courts had Juriſdiction over all Perſons, and in all Cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Temporal, called the Sanhedrim, (the great, the leſs) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and uſually, the Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>Which Synagogue, I ſay, was carried on by Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and never Excommunicated any man; that is, never debarr'd any man <hi>Synagogue, Church</hi> and never ſhut any man out of the Church or Temple if he was a Jew, though never ſo prophane.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Synagoghe, Church</hi> or <hi>Judges,</hi> or Juſtices of Peace, Magiſtrates <hi>(call them what you will, for they)</hi> were one and the ſame men, as they are at this day in <hi>Turk<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Joſhua</hi> (nor <hi>Eleazar</hi>) was commanded by God to look to and take care that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be Circumciſed the ſecond time; neither was he to except any amongſt them, or debar them from the Ordinance, although the moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and debaucht; (except haply they were Circumciſed before upon another ſcore, then indeed I do not know how they ſhould be Circumciſed again.)</p>
                     <p>And God commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> (not <hi>Eleazar</hi>) to Celebrate the <hi>Sacrament</hi> or <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> as ſoon as they had got over <hi>Jordan;</hi> nor from that Sacrament was the moſt vitious debarr'd, that ever we read of: the greateſt Sinner ſure had moſt need of it, for the whole have no need of Phyſick, but them that are ſick. <hi>Ely</hi> was <hi>Lord-Chief-Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Chief-Priest</hi> too, and ſo was <hi>Samuel.</hi>

                     <p>But our Bleſſed Saviour did not like that Spiritual Men ſhould dirty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the World, and Worldly matters; and therefore refuſed to be a Judg, (when the Preferment was proferr'd him) in Civil-matters, and charges his Diſciples that they likewiſe ſhould not exerciſe Dominion nor Lordſhip, as the Princes of the Gentiles, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25, 26. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> reads the Biſhops or Presbyters (for a Biſhop was a Presbyter in thoſe days) juſt ſuch another Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. But who minds what he or our Bleſſed Saviour (either) do ſay in the Caſe?</p>
                     <p>And yet we all pretend to be Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Certainly that Conſtitution and Frame of Government that cometh neareſt to the Platform (and is moſt agreeable and ſuiting with the Laws of God and is the beſt Form, and Frame of Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keep therefore and do them</hi> (ſays God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 4.6, 7, 8.) <hi>For this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nations, which ſhall hear all theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely this great nation is a wiſe and underſtanding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For what nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous; as all this Law which I ſet before you this day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in all that Law, (I will maintain it againſt the World) we do not read that any man living was for wickedneſs depriv'd of the benefit of the means of Grace, of the comfort and help of the Sacraments, Words, Sacrifices, or ſhut out and excluded the Church or Temple.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the Leper, and the Unclean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were debarred from the Crowd and Aſſembly (for fear of Infection in that hot Country) but no man's wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ill life and converſation, or miſdemeanor, or contempt, or ſcandalous behaviour was puniſhed by depriving him of the Word, or Sacraments, or means of Grace (that we read of) in the whole Scriptures, either Old or New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>And if it be not found in Holy-Writ, you may eaſily know whoſe invention it was.</p>
                     <p>For the truth is, Covetouſneſs invented it and Pride together; the Pope inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and being greedy and rapacious with his Legions of Lordly Prieſts and Cardinals that topt the whole World: and Money being a kind of neceſſary Utenſil in the Grandieur of Courts, as well as the ſinew of War, and crocking himſelf in vain by ſmutty Chymiſtry to find the Philoſophers-ſtone, he turn'd his Keys (of Heaven and Hell) into't, and made a Philoſophers-ſtone of them, and made them turn every thing (they touch't) to Gold.</p>
                     <p>Has any man a mind to go to Heaven? you muſt ask the Porter leave, he keeps the Keys (he ſays) of Heaven-gates, Come—enter in, but firſt pay the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leave your Purſe behind you, you'l need no money there; therefore—De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver your Purſe.</p>
                     <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour (indeed) does ſay to <hi>Peter, Behold, I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whoſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what's all that to the Pope more than other Presbyters? For Chriſt gives the ſame Commiſſion to all the Diſciples (after he had firſt breathed upon them the Holy-Ghoſt.) <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſins ye retain they are retained.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52560:13"/>
                     <p> And when the Pope or any other Popelings, or any other ſort of people are Succeſſors to theſe gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, or that Chriſt would vouchſafe to breathe upon them, or ſend down the Holy-Ghoſt upon them, as he did upon the Diſciples, then (and not till then) has any Mortal man power upon Earth to forgive ſins.</p>
                     <p>For who can forgive ſins but God only? ſaid the <hi>Phariſees</hi> truly; but they applied it wrongfully, through their ignorance of the Divinity of our Bleſſed Saviour, which he endeavoured to Diſcover unto them, by (that ſaying to the Cripple) <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven thee;</hi> but they were blind and could not ſee.</p>
                     <p>Can any man in his wits imagine that God ſhould give ſuch power unto men (the wickedeſt and vileſt of men) to forgive ſins?</p>
                     <p>Can any man be a good man, or indeed any thing in Religion, (in true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion) without true Charity?
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 'tis impoſſible, be his other qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and endowments never ſo great: be he Pope, or Biſhop, or Prieſt, or what he will.</p>
                     <p>And yet the Pope makes the ſilly Papiſts believe that he can fetch Souls (not only out of Purgatory) but alſo make <hi>All-Souls</hi> (in Hell) All-Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and leave the Devils alone, if he liſt.</p>
                     <p>Can he ſo? the more uncharitable Devil he (then) by his own ſhowing.</p>
                     <p>Had that wicked <hi>Levite</hi> a grain of Charity, that ſeeing a poor diſtreſſed man miſerably wounded, and that fell among Thieves, and turn'd his face (hard heart) and lookt another way, and went on the other ſide of the way, for fear he ſhould reach a helping-hand; give me the <hi>Samaritane</hi> for all ſuch <hi>Levites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Much leſs can the Pope have a grain of Charity, or (therefore) any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (indeed) or Religion, or any Chriſtianity, when he can (if he do not lie) redeem all the damned out of Hell, now roaring in torments, and will not; and all the Souls out of Purgatory (and the fire of Purgatory (the Papiſts hold) is hotter than <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s fiery Furnace, but I cannot tell, nor I hope ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall know:) and yet groaning and frying as they lie there, the Pope (hard-hearted wretch!) can deliver them, but not a Soul of them, except they, or ſome-body for them, down with their duſt, and ready <hi>Darby;</hi> they will not truſt for a twelve-penny piece, (which is the price of a Maſs (it ſeems) now a days, but when I was in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> they were cheaper, one might have had <hi>two for a ſhilling,</hi> and thank you too; nay, an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Fryar, a <hi>Teague Benedicite</hi> would make you twenty Legs too into the bargain, with <hi>Abou, bou, bou; by</hi> Chrees <hi>and by St.</hi> Patrick; <hi>Fait and Trot, by my Shoule, Joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Never did ſuch a ſilly cheat reign ſo long before in the whole World, but it was only becauſe they kept the people in ignorance; and if any man durſt offer to enlighten them, and ſpeak the Naked-Truth, the Pope, and his Inquiſition and Emiſſaries were as ſpightful, cruel and devilliſhly bloody as any are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us at this day againſt the Naked-Truth.</p>
                     <p>They are vildly loth to loſe their domineering, inſulting Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are as mad as <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> if men will not be Aſſes and tame Beaſts, and ſuffer themſelves (as of old) to be caw'd, crow'd over, and Prieſt-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Germans,</hi> That (juſt before) God had raiſed up <hi>Luther</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake them and rowze them, they were grown ſo fottiſh and be-jaded (having ſo long been Prieſt-ridden) that their Prieſts might almoſt have perſwaded them (not only to lye down and let the Prieſt whip them) or, (which is as bad or worſe) make them whip themſelves (both of them daily Penances at this day in Popiſh-Countries) but alſo they might eaſily have been perſwaded (poor Aſſes!) to eat Graſs.</p>
                     <p>Surely <hi>Engliſh</hi> men are not ſo dull and tame to be Hen-peckt? or to be rid and beſtrid at ſuch a rate, I hope: I confeſs, I have not the patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
                     <p>But though the Pope ſays Chriſt gave <hi>Peter</hi> (that is himſelf (he ſays) though his name be <hi>Pius, Sergius, Innocent</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi>) the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> be it ſo, we will not now quarrel about it: yet, how the Devil and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52560:13"/>he ſhould be ſo kind, that the Devil ſhould truſt him or prefer him to a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters place <hi>in the Kingdom of Hell,</hi> I cannot imagin; I am ſure there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it.</p>
                     <p>Nor any reaſon, or any thing elſe in the caſe, but the Money-caſe.</p>
                     <p>I think, I have ſufficiently evidenc't that in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. there's nothing like it; nor from (or in imitation of) the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Church, and Gods Platform of his own making, neither God nor Chriſt, in the Old nor New Teſtament ever gave Authority, Power or Command to any man, High-Prieſt or Low-Prieſt, or any Aſſembly of men, Clergy or Lay-Elders to turn men out of the Church, and ſhut and lock them out from Divine Ordinances (the comfort as well as cure of Sinners) much leſs did ever proſtitute ſuch Sacred Myſteries to ſale, and make a Money-matter or a Money-buſineſs of it; this was the inyention of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> the Money-God, or Money-Merchant; or his Factors, the Popelings.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, though I aſſert this, yet I do not deny but the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament may impower Biſhops or who they pleaſe, to Excommunicate, but, I ſay, I ſee no Scripture for Excommunication.</p>

                        <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Son of <hi>Herod</hi> was by his Father conſtituted and appointed (in his luſt Will and Teſtament) King after his Fathers Death, but he durſt not own the Name of King, till <hi>Caeſar</hi> confirm'd him.</p>
                     <p>Nor durſt the High-Prieſt act (till confirm'd by the <hi>Roman</hi>-Governour,) in any great affair; as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates in his 20th Book of Antiquities; and he was in a grievous quandary for procuring the Death of <hi>James</hi> (the Juſt) the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord, during the <hi>interregnum</hi> after <hi>Feſtus</hi> his Death, and before <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binas</hi> his Succeſſor was arriv'd in <hi>Judaea</hi> in his Government.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay the <hi>Romans</hi> uſually granted the Conquer'd <hi>Jews</hi> to uſe <hi>their own</hi> Laws, and to be govern'd by <hi>their own</hi> High-Prieſt and Countrymen, and <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> but always under favour and <hi>under correction</hi> ſtill of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Sanhedrim or a Synagogue (then) was the ſame (in Chriſt's time) as appointed in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> namely, the High-Court of Juſtice, and the Lower-Courts of Juſtice, and all the Magiſtracy they ever had.</p>
                     <p>But our Bleſſed Saviour he never changed the Government that was enacted and eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, nor ſuffered his Diſciples to innovate any thing in the Civil-Government, or (which is all one) Spiritual-Government, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, or Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>Which if our Saviour had ever ſpoke againſt, no doubt but his Adverſaries that lay at catch would have accuſed him of it, and laid it to his charge, when they ſo thirſted after his Blood.</p>
                     <p>Of this Court of <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Magiſtracy our Saviour ſpeaks, when he ſays (in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17.) tell it to the Church, or Synagoge, or Sanhedrim.</p>
                     <p>Which, I ſay, was not a meer Spiritual Court, no, no, it was no Bawdy-Court, but a Court of Juſtice, for Trying Cauſes, whipping men, beating them, ſtoning them to Death.</p>
                     <p>In this Court St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> were threatned, and St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſtoned, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. And the ſame Court had ſtoned <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> too, but that they durſt not for fear of the people that were ſo taken with them, for that a notable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had been done by them in curing a Cripple that was born Lame from his Mothers Womb, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. and this was ſuch an evident demonſtration of the hand of God going along with them, and done ſo publickly, and only with a word in the powerful Name of Jeſus, that the people could not but admire it and applaud it.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon they were put to a notable plunge, and when they had laid their Heads together, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.15. They were at their Wits end, and knew not what to do, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.16. For on the one hand they reſolv'd to do all the miſchief they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52560:14"/>could or durſt; and on the other hand they had no other colour for doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Apoſtles, but only that they had done good and cured a poor Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that would bear no colour for their intended cruelty againſt them; What ſhall they do? What ſhall they do?</p>
                     <p>They were miſchievouſly bent, and were reſolv'd to do as much miſchief as in them lay; but that that perplext them, and put them to this ſad perplexity, the people, the people could not be gull'd with any colourable miſt to blind their eyes, and make them believe they puniſht the Apoſtles for Treaſon, or Sedition or Hereſie; therefore the Text ſays, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Finding</hi> (they ſought but they could find) <hi>nothing how they might puniſh them</hi> (the Apoſtles) why could they find nothing? 'tis anſwered in that Text—<hi>Becauſe of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ay, ay, that's the right and only way of return to God for manifeſtation of any <hi>Naked-Truth</hi> by his Servants, to glorifie his Name for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And why ſhould not the Sanhedrim have glorified God for the ſame, as well as the people? Had not they Souls to ſave as well as the people? What was this <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> or High-Court of Juſtice made up of? Who were the Members of this Council?</p>
                     <p>It is anſwered, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.1. The Prieſts (Ay, Ay, I ſhould have wondred elſe, at a piece of miſchief, if I had not found the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Prieſts there in the firſt place, next) the Captain of the Temple, and the Sadduces.</p>
                     <p>A fine medley; of Prieſts, Soldiers, and Atheiſts; for ſo were the Sadduces: the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Church was like to be well govern'd; nor do I wonder they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, in the next Verſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.2. to ſuſpend the Apoſtles <hi>ab officio,</hi> or ſilence them from Preaching, being grieved (good hearts!) that they taught the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:—Whereupon they put them in Jayl for that Night, (deſigning to get all or a greater number of their Council together (upon ſo good an occaſion too) And then appears a great Motley crew, made up of Rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, and <hi>Annas</hi> the High-Prieſt, and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and all the High-Prieſts Nephews, Couſins and Couſin-Germans.</p>
                     <p>This is only to ſhow you what the Church was that our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> is as much as to ſay in <hi>England,</hi>—Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi> Seſſions, or Aſſizes.</p>
                     <p>For want of the knowledg whereof, Excommunication has been counted a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance, and every little gather'd Church (as well as the great) took upon them the Government, and thought themſelves ſome-body, and would have power over their own Members; to interdict, deprive, cut off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and woful work they made with it; <hi>Johnſon</hi> and others that fled to <hi>Holland,</hi> and had a gathered-Church, and cut of, and cut off Hereticks, and wrong Believers, till he left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, or but with one, that juſt jumpt with him in all things.</p>
                     <p>And indeed (as in the Mathematicks) when a crooked Line deviates from a ſtreight Line, the further it reaches in length, ſtill the greater diſtance and more irreconcileable: ſo here this Text of <hi>Matt.</hi> 18 17. being miſtaken and wrong conſtrued, the longer the error laſts, the greater miſchief and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be reconciled.</p>
                     <p>For this Interpretation has leaven'd not only <hi>Dioceſan, Synodical,</hi> but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Independent, and Congregational-Churches, till they have fought one another with this Spiritual-Weapon moſt Bloodily, and they knew not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; they are miſtaken in the words of their Commiſſion, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deny not but that a Bigot, Papiſt, Proteſtant, Presbyterian, or any other Sect (that believes the Church has this power, at this day, to bind and looſe, and knows no better than the old Traditional-Interpretation of theſe words —<hi>Tell the Church</hi>) have, and may ſtill (if they pleaſe) be frighted out of their little Wit with the thunder of Excommunication; thinking it <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and that the Thunder comes from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>But I doubt not, but to prove how far it is a meer earthly Cracker, and a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and frights none but Women and Fools; were it not for the Writ—<hi>de Excommunicato capiendo</hi>—that follows in the Rear of it.</p>

                     <p> I know well how the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger was frighted out of his little Wit, becauſe a ſilly Monk had Excommunicated him, and could not eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drink, nor ſleep till he abſolv'd him; there has and will be Bigotted Fools and Coxcombs to the Worlds end.</p>
                     <p>Nay, men that are in all other things wiſe, yet if they once be poſſeſſed with the Spirit of Bigottiſm and Superſtition, and be Prieſt-ridden, not minding what the Holy Scriptures ſay, but what comments the Prieſts (for their own lucre, and to uphold their Prelatical Hierarchy Dominion and Uſurpation) put upon it, are eaſily Bugbear'd with this cracker of Excommunication: as was that braveſt of Men and Warriours, the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Elder, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the greater ſinner of the two.</p>
                     <p>Not but that the Emperor might be in fault, in ſome fault, (as what great Warriour and Conqueror (as he was) can poſſibly be innocent, and have hands clean from any ſtain of Blood,) but whether he was in fault or no, is not eaſie to determine; read the Story in <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and though the Emperor did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Soldiers to humble the City (that were certainly Traytors, and were Guilty <hi>laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> in abuſing moſt ſhamefully the Statues and Picture of his dear Wife and Empreſs, and poſſibly the Soldiers might (they are apt enough, to) exceed their Commiſſion when there is good plunder in the caſe. But the poor Emperor muſt pay for all, and ſmart for all.</p>
                     <p>For indeed he was not Emperor (but a Bigot) I mean, he did not know his own Strength, Power and Authority, but ſuffered himſelf to be nuzzled by <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that formerly had been a Captain, and now was made Biſhop of the ſame Town <hi>(Milan)</hi> that he had formerly been Governour of; but he forgot not his ſtout heart, though he had put on his Canonical-Weeds: read but the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is too long here to inſert, but, you will then (with me) pity the poor Bigot Emperor, got into ill-handling, and under the clutches of a Prieſt that well knew the Aſcendant he had over him.</p>
                     <p>For even in theſe days a Biſhoprick begun to be a ſtately buſineſs, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good (but a great) thing, and had been ſo (of 100 years ſtanding;) namely, ever ſince the good Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had been ſo wonderfully Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of them Biſhops, and therefore he made them rich; and riches are apt to make men proud; and pride is apt to make men fall: And there's an end on't.</p>
                     <p>But if the Sanhedrim or Synagogue had been a Spiritual-Court only (as men make it that thus Conſtrue—<hi>Tell the Church</hi>) then certainly it was a Bloody Court as well as a Bawdy Court; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes that he had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence to Impriſon men, and put them to Death, which ſurely was Law; or elſe King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Feſtus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>-Governour would have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed him for it, when he confeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.10. that—many of the Holy men he ſhut up in Priſon, having received Authority from the Chief-Prieſts (mark that) and when they were put to Death, he gave his Vote for it; and puniſht them oft in every Synagogue, or Church; ſo that I ſay, Tell it to the Church, or Synagogue; (is) Complain to the Juſtice, and no more.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſtrange indeed that Chriſt ſhould in thoſe Words of <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. ſet up a new Juriſdiction in the World, and the Apoſtles (who at that time knew nothing of nulling any of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that Chriſt ſhould die, and yet) ſhould make no exception to it, or queſtion to have it more explain'd, if it were to be a ſtanding Sacred Ordinance to vouch Excommunication to the Worlds end.</p>
                     <p>And as ſtrange that none of the Evangeliſt, (but St. <hi>Matthew</hi> only) ſhould make any mention of it; only St. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3. makes ſome little hint of forgiving our Brother, but not a word of putting him into Court, or preſenting him.</p>
                     <p>If we can but as well get over the 18th Verſe, I fear Excommunication will tremble and ſhake for fear of being Excommunicated its-ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Matt. 18.18. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi>

                     <p>So alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. There's an Order ſent out for Excommunication, thereby Decreeing the Inceſtuous Perſon to be Excommunicated. And, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20.

                     <p>Theſe are the chief, if not the only places, pretended to vouch the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                     <p>But as idle and far from the purpoſe as if we ſhould alledg, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. to prove our ſelves Believers; namely, <hi>He that believeth ſhall not be damn'd:</hi> And theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe, <hi>In my name ſhall they caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> (hence comes the Popiſh Holy-Order called Exorciſts, or Conjurers) <hi>They ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence came the Opinion of the neceſſity of Univerſity-Learning, and to be a Linguiſt before you are capable of being in Orders (or to be a Teacher or Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.) <hi>They ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it ſhall not hurt them;</hi> (but (here) in this the Popiſh Mimickry and Mountebank-Tricks, in endeavouring to imitate the Holy-Ghoſt, wanted courage and faith to play tricks, and try concluſions:) They ſhall lay hands on the ſick and they ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (there's no danger in trying that experiment) but becauſe the Prieſt palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor ſick man did not reſtore him to life, they would palm him indeed (in their Holy Unction) and Anoint him with Oyl in the name of the Lord, but being fruitleſs, they ſay, it is not for life, but death, not to cure, but kill, and they never anoint them but when the Phyſitians have given them over and paſt Recovery: whereas the Apoſtles laying hands was for their Recovery.</p>
                     <p>But now in Popiſh Countries (I know it) if once the Phyſicians have given a ſick man over, the Clergy have him then; and though nature (as many times) ſhakes off and Conquers the Diſeaſe, yet they will not ſuffer the ſick man to take either Food on Phyſick, till they be paid for the Burial, and Funeral charges, and his Legacies to Monaſteries, Fryars, Nuns, &amp;c. made good in his life-time, and paid (live or die:) a moſt Barbarous, Inhumane and Devillſh Religion, as ever any Prince could be converted unto, that did not alſo hope to go ſnips with them in their Arbitrary-Tyranny, Cruelty, Oppreſſion, and Bloody mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay thoſe Texts to Legitimate Excommunication, (that has ſo vext and perplext, and ruin'd the Peace of Chriſtendom, and all Chriſtian-Societies, and humanity it ſelf, (the true <hi>Lycanthropye,</hi> that has turn'd men to Wolves, to worry one another) is no more to the purpoſe to vouch Excommunication now a days, becauſe the Apoſtles could bind and looſe, deliver to (and free from) Satan, (no more I ſay) than that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. can be brought to prove that we are all Infidels, and ſhall be damn'd.</p>
                     <p>For immediately after he ſays, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damn'd,</hi> he adds marks and ſigns to know who ſhall be damn'd, or who does, and who does not believe; namely, <hi>They ſhall caſt out Devils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p> But hence comes the miſchief in the Chriſtian-Church, men will take upon them to be Doctors, (and I know not what) Interpreters of Scriptures, but they never mind the context, or if they do, they imbibe their Principles from their Mother, or School-Dame, or Paedagogue, or Tutor. Hence, men of equal Parts and Pregnancy live and dye Papiſts or Proteſtants. Wherefore? their Nurſe, and Paedagogue, and Education were ſuch; (a fine account!) and yet every man knows 'tis true: And they are no fools neither, in Trade, in Law, in Human-Learning—equally excellent, but Imbib'd Superſtitions few men have reaſon and ſtrength to ſhake off, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his Cords and Wyths;</p>

                     <p>Otherwiſe 'tis impoſſible but men ſhould know the fallacy of the conſequence, that what the Apoſtles could, did, or had order to do; therefore we may or muſt do it: What non-ſence is this?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> trod Water, (at Chriſt's bidding) and yet ne'er a Prieſt in <hi>England</hi> dare venture to follow him or imitate him, except he can ſwim; nor pretend (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) to be his Succeſſor Apoſtolical.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> kill'd <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> with a word; there's ne'er a Prieſt in the World (I do not ſay will, but) can imitate him; if he could, he ſhould not then need to have employ'd the Magiſtrate in his drudgery—to Burn Hereticks, and Jayl thoſe that the Prieſts Excommunicate; (a mighty Honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) and the Magiſtrate is mightily beholden to the Clergy for the Office, mean while <hi>(But this by Parentheſis.)</hi>

                        <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſhaddow paſſing by, cured the ſick; they that pretend to his Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Succeſſors, and Apoſtolical men, never cured any man:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> with one Sermon Converted 3000 Souls: The Apoſtolical pretenders Preach not one farthing better (many much leſs, I do not ſay much worſe) than when they were poor Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> ſet ope' the Priſon-Doors and made a Goal-delivery: But ſome the Goals would fill, if they might have their Will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid indeed—<hi>Silver and gold have I none</hi>—And theſe indeed ſcarce know when (nor think) they have enough.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, as I ſaid once before, I proteſt, I do not know wherein St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) Succeſſor, imitates <hi>Peter,</hi> but in denying his Maſter; I wiſh I could ſee him on the ſtool of Repentance, and weep (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) weep bitterly: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making others weep, with their Inquiſitions, High-Commiſſions, and their Tricks and Shams, making the poor Widow and Orphans weep and curſe them; <hi>Apostolical men!</hi> Succeſſors and Imitators of the Apoſtle! For ſhame no more! With what Forehead? I hate the Impudence more than the Hypocriſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> labour'd with his hands to get a Living: others labour to undo men and their Families. <hi>Paul</hi> had a Viper on his hand, did him no hurt; others have Vipers in their hearts, and do as much hurt and miſchief as in them lyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> raiſed <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter to life; theſe, breathe nothing, but Goals, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lories, Excommunication and Deſtruction:</p>

                     <p> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> Excommunicated Swearers and Blaſphemers; and ſome Popes (Hiſtory ſays) and Apoſtolical men would Blaſpheme upon occaſion, Curſe and Swear like Hectors: But what and wherefore, <hi>in nomine Domini,</hi> do theſe men pretend Right to Excommunicate, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> did it, or the Primitive Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth?</hi> (that had both St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpecial order for it, and his Spirit, and his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4.)</p>
                     <p>They had Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt (particularly that, without which no man was ſo impudent to bind or looſe, or pretend to the power of the Keys in the Primitive times, that wanted it) namely, the Gift of Diſcerning of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſee through a man, into him, into his very heart; ſo could St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore did that, which is a ſin in any of us to do, that have not the gift of Diſcerning of Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> called the Conjurer <hi>Elymas, Enemy of all righteouſneſs, and Son of a—Devil:</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by his Spirit, perceiv'd that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs and the bond of iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Pope and Popelings are ready enough at calling of Names, but <hi>clavis er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> they Nick-name men, and call him a Child of the Devil, that is more a Child of God (a thouſand times than themſelves) and yet they'l be doing their endeavour and good-will to deliver them to Satan, and yet God will not ſuffer Satan to take one of them that they Excommunicate, that we know of; no ſigns, nor marks on't: but rather, as they ſay, of the Foxes proverbially, The more they are curſt, the better they thrive. Take him Satan; Satan will not: then take him Magiſtrate, he muſt.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that made the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> Excommunicate the Inceſtuous perſon, it was for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, and Diſeaſes (as they did <hi>Job,</hi> when God Excommunicated him or delivered him to Satan) either kill'd him, or brought him nigh unto the Grave; if great Godly ſorrow did not intervene.</p>
                     <p>Away—with this Mimickry and Pageantry, and Apiſh Imitation—</p>
                     <p>If we have the Spirit of the Apoſtles, we are Apoſtolical men indeed; they, <hi>(Peter and John) Acts</hi> 8.17. <hi>Layd their hands on the Diſciples, and they received the gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, the Pope and Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will be imitating, and ſeem to do ſomething, and they'l Confirm by Laying on of Hands (but not that neither right, according to their own Rubricks, as I'le ſhow by and by) but <hi>cui bono?</hi> Away with Lying and Vanity, let God be True and every man a Lyar; I would appeal to any mans Conſcience, If ever he received any Gift of the Holy-Ghoſt by ſuch Impoſition of Hands, and ſpeak the Naked-Truth now, and do not cogg, lye and flatter your ſelf, nor diſſemble: any of you that ever was B— Be-Pop't, or that any Pope would tell truly and not lye, Whether he felt (whilſt he was at it with Impoſition of Hands) that any vertue went out of him, as it did out of our Saviour, when he did the Woman good.</p>
                     <p>Away, Away, with Folly and Pageantry at this time of day, God will not be mocked; <hi>And every Plant that my Heavenly Father hath not planted ſhall be rooted out,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Redeemer, and I believe him, let Hell and the Pope think themſelves never ſo cock-ſure and culminant.</p>
                     <p>'Tis readily granted that if any man was a Heretick, they ſhould avoid him; or reject him, and caſt off his Company in ordinary Converſation; and if any Brother walked diſorderly, they ſhould not eat nor drink, nor dine nor ſup with him, that he might be aſhamed.</p>
                     <p>But to think, that God or good Men, the Prophets, Chriſt or his Apoſtles, did ever in the Old or New Teſtament command any Men, Synod or Synagogue, Church or Court, that they ſhould ſhut the Church Doors, and ſhut out the worſt of Sinners from the Sacraments, or Communion, or hale them into Church (either) by the Head and Ears; or (which is the ſame) Excommunicate him, or put him out of Commons, (or the Communion) of the Church, the only Food and Cure of our Souls, and made on purpoſe for Sinners, is an opinion as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52560:16"/>ſenceleſs and groundleſs as it has been baneful and miſchievous to all Societies, and the Peace of Chriſtendom.</p>
                     <p>I grant though, <hi>ſacra ſacris,</hi> and Holy things ought not to be caſt to Dogs, therefore the Text ſays, <hi>Examin your ſelves, and ſo eat of this bread and drink of this cup.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Examin himſelf?</hi> It is not ſaid examin him, Prieſt, and confeſs him, you Prieſt, and Catechize him, <hi>John Presbyter,</hi> nor you Lay-Elder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But let him examin himſelf, and ſo let him come</hi>—but <hi>ſao piculo,</hi> at his own Peril.</p>
                     <p>But the Church, nor the beſt of men, are not defiled with communicating with the vileſt of ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Was there ever any better than our Bleſſed Saviour, or worſe than <hi>Judas?</hi> yet Chriſt eat the Paſſeover with him, and probably, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; yet he then knew him, and had Publiſht him a Traytor, whom (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he call'd—Devil.</p>
                     <p>I hate the Puritanical Phariſaical Hypocriſie of any Religion; they ſhall be defiled with communicating with Sinners, Drunkards! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (as good as the beſt of them) are not commanded to forſake the Lords-Table, though we read that ſome came thither Drunk, and to fill their Bellies with the Bread and Wine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21.</p>
                     <p>Alas! every man has enough to do (if he mind it well) to look after his own Preparation, but that any that had not the Giſt of Diſcerning of Spirits (nor theſe neither) did Excommunicate, or forbid the Communion to any, in the Old or New Teſtament, (I boldly ſay) 'tis falſe; Nor can they prove, but that he that was delivered to Satan, did alſo come (if he could for Diſeaſes) to Sacraments, Prayers, and to Church, the ready road to have his Spirit ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I wiſh they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> that is, I wiſh the Devil had them in his power to inflict Death or Diſeaſes upon them; for it is impoſſible that the Apoſtles ſhould be ſo uncharitable to their Spirits or Souls as to wiſh them cut off from the Church, Militant or Triumphant; except by ſome extraordinary and particular Revelation.</p>
                     <p>For cutting off, and delivering to Satan, are the ſame thing; and it is clear the Apoſtles lookt upon the Inceſtuous Perſon that was delivered over to Satan, as a dying or dead man, becauſe he adds—<hi>That his ſpirit might be ſav'd in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, we never find in Holy Writ that Interdicting the Sacraments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring from the Communion, was ever uſed for a Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The Leper, or he that had touched a Dead Body, or a Menſtrous Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Excommunicated properly, or put from Holy Communion; but theſe Impediments did as likely befall to the good as well as to the bad, and was not put for a Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Oh! but this was a Type of Excommunication under the Goſpel. That's good, and well ſaid; a Type of that that never was, and never will be; firſt prove Excommunication a Goſpel-Ordinance, and then 'tis time enough to ſhow where it was Typified.</p>
                     <p>And as if Real (and not only Typical) holineſs were not as requiſite under the Law as under the Goſpel; it was a ſin, then, (as well as now) to make many Prayers when the hands were full of Blood.</p>
                     <p>And ſtrange it is that the Apoſtle that warns <hi>Timothy, Tites,</hi> and the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> (or Biſhops, for the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Verſ 17. are called Biſhops, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28.

                     <p> And that our Bleſſed Jeſus, that took ſuch care to mind <hi>Peter,</hi> if he lov'd him, to feed his Lambs and ſeed his Sheep; ſhould not (if it be a ſacred Ordinance) ſpeak a word, to fleece them, and ſcourge them, and interdict them ſpiritual food, upon occaſion, or, if they ſtray.</p>
                     <p>No, no, if they ſtray, thou that art a good Shepherd, reduce them; thou art well kept and paid for the very nonce.</p>
                     <p>Which brings to my mind this Parable or Story, I will not ſay 'tis true and real, more than the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> And it begins too juſt as that Parable begins.</p>
                     <p>There was two certain rich men, which were Cloathed in Purple and Fine-Linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, but all theſe good things were frankly beſtowed on them at the mercy, and by the favour of the King, upon condition (though) that they would be Shepherds and feed his Sheep, and anoint them for the Scab, and underlook them, but not worry them, nor deſtroy them; nor Fleece them, nor Shear them to their own private uſe, nor plague them, nor vex them, though perhaps the Sheep might ſometimes ſtray and ſtraggle, and go a wrong Road, and tire (perhaps) and fret the Shepherds with following and running after them; yet they were not to revenge themſelves upon the ſtray Sheep, and ſet their Wit againſt theirs, but gently reduce them, and do nothing raſhly, maliciouſly, revengefully or peeviſhly, except perhaps ſome of the Sheep ſhould be incurably ſcab'd; and then the King promiſed he would give the Shepherds good Wages and Hire, and they ſhould want for nothing.</p>
                     <p>Who would have refus'd a Shepherds office upon theſe eaſie terms? or who would deſire better terms, than to do good, not to kill, not to do miſchief, not to deſtroy?</p>
                     <p>But ſo it hapned, that the two Shepherds, though they had ſeveral Flocks, and ſeveral fat Paſtures, yet the Sheep graz'd all on one Common in diſtinct Flocks, whilſt the Shepherds could meet together and view them, and over-ſee them, and yet enjoy one another, feaſt together, and laugh and talk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>And (as I ſaid before) they wanted for nothing; but their Pouches was full of Money, their Bottles full of good Wine, and their Scrips full of good Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and variety enough.</p>
                     <p>Yet, ſo it was one morning, one of the Shepherds came to the other puffing and blowing, fretting and fuming, and ſo out of breath that he could ſcarce tell his Tale.</p>
                     <p>At length, and after ſome pauſe, recovering himſelf, Brother Shepherd (quoth he) was ever man ſo plagu'd as I have been this morning with running after a ſtray Sheep, Wanton and Fat? I think he has led me a fair dance, I am ſo tyred, I have ſcarce breath enough left to tell you, and to make this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
                     <p>Indeed and indeed (quoth the other to his Brother) and is this true? yea, very true (replied he) ſee but how I fret and ſweat: his Brother being tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, could not but pity and take compaſſion on his fellow Labourer, and ſo much the more, becauſe for ought he knew his own Flock might take example thereat, and lead him a dance, he knew not how ſoon, and put him alſo in the ſame pickle, ſweat and <hi>balnio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They parted (though) for that time to conſider alone, and afterwards joyn Heads together and ſtudy how to be reveng'd of the ſaid wanton fat Weather, if it were but for example-ſake to all the other fat Sheep in the Flock; (for the lean Hags (poor Souls) were tame enough, they had more mind to graze and eat than to be gameſome! and they kept them to ſharper Commons, on purpoſe to make them be gentle and eaſie to be guided.)</p>
                     <p>Well, ſomething muſt be done, that was reſolv'd; but what, or how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, they could not well tell.</p>
                     <p>Let's eat him, ſays one; Ay, quoth the other, that would not be amiſs, but the craft's in the catching him; you ſaw I ſweat with but running after him, and could ſcarce give him a turn. Beſides, we have Victuals enough of our own,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52560:17"/>and need it not; and alſo the King has commanded, Feed my Sheep, but Fleece them not, much more <hi>do not kill, Do not ſteal,</hi> let them live and 'mend: they would have turn'd him out of the Flock too, but they had no Commiſſion for that.</p>
                     <p>At length, one of them found out a Quirk, an Evaſion, an Exception in their Commiſſion, <hi>viz. Except perhaps ſome of the Sheep ſhould be incurably ſcab'd;</hi> and, I ſay, He is a ſcabbed Sheep: How ſhall we prove that, quoth the other? for I underſtand by you that he is ſo wanton he would never ſuffer you to come ſo near him as to feel him and handle him; and for my own part, quoth he, I did never ſo much as ſee him in my life, nor do I deſire it, except we could get him faſt into ſome Pen or Pound: And then—Wherefore it was reſolv'd to catch him; and to that purpoſe, they ſet their Shepherd's Dogs upon him, but what the Iſſue was, I cannot tell.</p>
                     <p>For here's enough (for Diverſion) of a Sheepiſh harmleſs Parable, at which no man can be offended that is either innocent or wiſe; for none but a fool will challenge it for his own, for his own Character.</p>

                     <p>But Holy <hi>David</hi> was a man after God's own heart; the evil Spirit is too great in ſome mens hearts, the evil Spirit of malice and revenge poſſeſſes them too much to be good at any thing ſo readily, as miſchief, miſchief; to their power, I mean, to their utmoſt: It is a ſin to bid ſuch—God ſpeed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Text tells us—<hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh</hi> (his luſtful Fleſh, or fleſhly Luſts) not for the deſtruction of his Eſtate, Freedom or earthly Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but <hi>that his ſpirit might be ſaved:</hi> All the <hi>deſign,</hi> and all the <hi>management,</hi> and all the <hi>conſequences</hi> were <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> purely <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour (though it <hi>was proffer'd</hi> him, and <hi>ſome would never</hi> have refuſed the <hi>Preferment,</hi> that have not the mind of Chriſt) <hi>would not be a Judg</hi> in Civil matters, Counſellor nor Privy-Counſellor.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>his</hi> Kingdom was a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Kingdom, <hi>his</hi> Rule a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Rule in mens <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> his <hi>Weapons</hi> were <hi>not Carnal but Spiritual,</hi> for the bringing <hi>down of ſtrong Holds;</hi> not <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Mannors:</hi>

                     <p>We thought it a <hi>fair deliverance</hi> from this Popiſh thraldom, when we were delivered from the Inquiſition, High-Commiſſion, Racks and Gibbets, Fire and Faggot too <hi>(of late)</hi> by condemning the Writ <hi>de Heretico Comburendo.</hi>

                     <p>But I am not bound to anſwer this Objection; only it brings to my mind, the temper and opinion the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> were of concerning the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and their <hi>Viſitations,</hi> (ſome years after the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> was cut down, in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi>) in <hi>H.</hi> VIII's time, expreſſed by the coupling together of two words in 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8.21. namely, <hi>Viſit or Vex;</hi> as if they were <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> or the one explanatory of the other; <hi>Viſit or Vex?</hi> good; The King and Parliament had a good opinion of the Biſhops Viſitations, in the <hi>interim,</hi> to count them vexatious, and to make proviſion for the King's Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels to be freed and exempt from their Viſitations; I ſhall never forget it— <hi>Viſit or Vex;</hi> nay, I know it experimentally; a moſt admirable Couple, or Conjunctive Copulative—<hi>Viſit or Vex;</hi> good, incomparable! well, ſince that wiſe King and Parliament put them together, let them go—<hi>Viſit or Vex.</hi>

                     <p>And <hi>to ſalve</hi> the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8, 9. and the <hi>Penalties</hi> there, <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop

                     <p>Nay, it looks like a <hi>Wheedle,</hi> or a <hi>Trepan,</hi> to drill a Man into a Court by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a <hi>feigned Suit,</hi> and then <hi>clap an Action</hi> on his Back at another Man's Suit, and without his Privity too: but any methods to carry on the <hi>Cauſe, The Cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, according to the <hi>uſual Methods</hi> of this Court, no Man is obliged to <hi>accept a Libel</hi> except the Promoter become bound in ſufficient Penalty (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>reſponſable</hi> and <hi>ſufficient Sureties,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>capable</hi> of being <hi>Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>) in caſe of <hi>Non-ſuit</hi> (or <hi>failure of proof,</hi>) to pay to the Defendant his Coſts and Damages.</p>

                     <p> Sixthly, The Vicaridge of <hi>Fingringhoe</hi> is void by the Statute, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8.3. by reaſon the ſaid <hi>Samuel Harris</hi> Clerk (in the third Article mentioned) (being Inſtituted and Inducted in or about the month of <hi>December</hi> laſt paſt, yet) has not paid the King's Tenths to the value (with Charges thereupon in the Exchequer) of 30 or 40 <hi>l.</hi> now due, and refuſed to be paid, (or neglected by the ſaid Biſhop to be demanded of him perſonally) or if demanded lawfully, then the ſaid Vicaridge is void, and ought to be ſo declared, and the Right of Patronage or Advowſon being in this Defendant, together with the great Tythes and Impropriation of <hi>Fingringhoe</hi> aforeſaid, the Cuſtody of the Profits of the ſaid Vicaridge does belong (during the Vacancy) to this Defendant the Patron, (as this Defendant humbly conceives by force of the Statutes 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.1.) But if diſputable be this Defendants Title to the ſame, yet neither this Court, nor any Eccleſiaſtical Court can hold Plea thereof nor of any matter whereof the King's Courts have Right of Juriſdiction, 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.13. nor can determine the Titles and Rights of Freehold (as 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.4. 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.3. 17 (alias) 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.11.) aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the ſaid <hi>Harris never</hi> was <hi>Reſident</hi> ſo much as one night in the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>Fingringhoe,</hi> ſince his firſt Induction to the ſaid Vicaridge thereof, but preach'd three or four times to the Pariſhioners, <hi>got half a years Tythes,</hi> and never came in the ſaid Pariſh <hi>(not once)</hi> ſince <hi>June</hi> laſt, but <hi>hired out himſelf</hi> (a Curate in <hi>London</hi>) under Dr. <hi>Grove</hi> to this day; ſo that the Defendants ſaid Pariſh (of which he is Patron) is miſerably abus'd, the Cure deſerted, the Flock neglected, the Fleece only expected, and neither His Majeſties Tenths paid, nor the Vicaridge disburthen'd thereof; for the payment of which Tenths to His Majeſty, this Defendant deſires this Court, to ſequeſter the Profits, and better provide for the Cure, both which the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid Promoter, neglects to do; ſo that great harm, but no good, is done by this Interruption, and <hi>Fingringhoe</hi> has alſo cauſe to ſay, <hi>Seldom comes a better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is it any great additional Honour to the <hi>Paſtoral Staff,</hi> (that pretends a <hi>whole Dioceſs</hi> to be <hi>its Flock,</hi> Cure and Charge, even of <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> therein, (a pretty great burden and <hi>weight</hi> for a <hi>ſingle ſhoulder</hi>) that not ſatisfied to be <hi>well paid</hi> for <hi>ſitting ſtill,</hi> muſt be doing and medling, though it had much better <hi>do nothing,</hi> than <hi>do miſchief</hi> and harm.</p>
                     <p>'Tis well the Archbiſhop is the <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops;</hi> and as much ſuperior and <hi>elevated above the common</hi> or ordinary Biſhop, as a Biſhop above the little Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis proper, in this Caſe, to let the Archbiſhop know (that he may take notice and <hi>correct) the neglect</hi> of the ſaid Promoter, the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>neglecting to collect</hi> His Majeſties Arrearages of the Tenths (afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) due from the ſaid <hi>Harris,</hi> the ſaid <hi>little Vicar of</hi> Fingringhoe; and his <hi>ſin of omiſſion,</hi> in neglecting <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to demand</hi> the ſaid great Arrearages (of Tenths) of the ſaid <hi>Harris,</hi> when he has (as he has frequently) met with him; or, upon refuſal, and non-payment, to have declared the ſaid Vicaridge, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> void of the ſaid Incumbent, <hi>as if he was dead,</hi> as is enjoined by and in the ſaid Statute 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>That ſo the Patron might preſent a <hi>better man,</hi> and the neglect of His Majeſties ſaid Revenue be no longer <hi>conniv'd and wink'd at:</hi> nor the <hi>Cure of Souls in</hi> Fingringhoe aforeſaid be ſo neglected and <hi>abandoned,</hi> and much <hi>worſe provided</hi> for by the ſaid Biſhop the <hi>Promoter,</hi> in this Caſe, than ever.</p>
                     <p>Whil'ſt there is none to Adminiſter the Holy Sacraments there, nor to Baptize or Catechize their Children, Bury the Dead, Read Divine Service, nay, nor ſo much as a Sermon read by the ſaid Curate <hi>Harris,</hi> or <hi>rather Reader,</hi> (for he can do nothing elſe but read) whil'ſt the honeſt Pariſhioners have cauſe to bewail theſe Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and bemoan the fruits of (this) Diſcord, that whil'ſt the ſaid Promoter intended to <hi>ſtrike</hi> this Defendant, he <hi>miſt his blow, and hit</hi> none but the harmleſs Pariſhioners, who (good men) <hi>pay for all,</hi> and <hi>All for nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For though the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> has <hi>let out himſelf to work</hi> (a kind of <hi>Journey-work</hi>) under the ſaid Dr. <hi>Grove,</hi> yet he has not quite ſo forgot his Pariſhioners, but that he has moſt <hi>magiſterially commanded</hi> them to ſend him money for half a years Tythes, or elſe he has <hi>threatned</hi> them that <hi>he will</hi>—Ay, <hi>that he will</hi>—</p>
                     <p>'Tis meet, that this Court of Arches, or Archbiſhop, (if it can do any thing) that it ſhould <hi>correct</hi> the faults of <hi>Biſhops: We muſt even turn the Tables</hi>—</p>
                     <p>Nor will any Body pity thoſe buſie Medlers and <hi>Maſter-workmen,</hi> that cannot be content <hi>to overſee</hi> the Labourers <hi>hard at work,</hi> and well wrought and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they muſt be <hi>placing</hi> and <hi>diſplacing</hi> ſtones in the Building, and ſet them a <hi>tumbling</hi> and rowling, 'till they <hi>fall upon their own Pates</hi>—</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But in this particular Caſe</hi> of ſolemnizing Matrimony without Banes or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the Canons or Conſtitutions that go under the name of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> in Print, are <hi>vaſtly different</hi> one from the other; Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Canons and Injunctions ordaining for ſuch Offence a Suſpenſion (<hi>ab of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio onely,</hi> and ſo particularly expreſt) onely <hi>for the ſpace of ſix months.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thoſe under the names of King <hi>James,</hi> ordain <hi>for the like Offence</hi> a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion <hi>for three (long) years;</hi> a long time for a painful and laborious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to <hi>live with his mouth ſtopt,</hi> and upon ſuch an occaſion too, that not one word is ſaid to it, <hi>nor any body aggrieved,</hi> if the ſaid Regiſters and Commiſſaries <hi>go but ſwips</hi> in the (pretended) Licence, and <hi>have a feeling in the hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which makes it more than probable, that thoſe ſaid Canons and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>not truly Printed;</hi> nor is any man bound to take notice of them, except they be <hi>Recorded</hi> in a <hi>Court of Record,</hi> and a true Copy be produced in ſuch Court, (and particularly <hi>in this Court</hi> upon this Suit, and this occaſion) and the <hi>Truth thereof ſworn</hi> upon Oath of good and <hi>creaible Witneſſes,</hi> which this Defendant does hereby require in this Caſe and Suit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules and Methods of Law and Juſtice, Reaſon and Equity.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the ſaid <hi>(pretended)</hi> Canon of King <hi>James,</hi> ordaining Suſpenſion in general, ought by the Rules of the Civil Law, Reaſon and Common Law, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the mildeſt ſenſe:</p>
                     <p>For there being two kind of Suſpenſions, namely, 1. <hi>Ab Officio.</hi> 2. <hi>A Beneficio.</hi> The firſt <hi>only damages the Flock and Pariſh.</hi> The ſecond <hi>alſo ſtarves the poor Priest and all his Family;</hi> oh Cruelty! for a <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> when no man is damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, but <hi>a greedy Regiſter and Commiſſary,</hi> (they that buy muſt ſell) and if their mouths be but ſtopt with <hi>Guinees,</hi> the Miniſter's ſhall never be ſtop't; the Fault's alledged againſt this Defendant for ſolemnizing, or rather prophaning Matrimony without Banes—being only in the years 1680 and 1681. when he took but about 5 s. for the ſame, (the People being the gainers thereby;) but when this Defendant married ten times more in the years 1674, 1675, 1676, 1677, 1678, and 1679. and made the People pay for a pretended Licence and Marriage, about 12 s. or 13 s. of which, each the ſaid Regiſters and Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had 8 s. apiece: Then, (oh no!) Then; <hi>not a word to be ſaid,</hi> nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters heard of againſt him.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>after the writing the Naked Truth,</hi> that tells them roundly of their crying Extortions and Oppreſſions of the King's Subjects, in illegal (Fees, or rather) Exactions, in <hi>Probates, of Wills,</hi> Letters of <hi>Adminiſtrations, Ordinations, Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Inductions, Viſitations, Synodals, Procurations, Excommunications,</hi> and <hi>Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> (in anſwer whereof neither they, nor one <hi>Fullwood</hi> their <hi>Doughty-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> has ſo much as one word to ſay in their Defence) Then nothing will ſerve but <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Deſolation,</hi> in Plots and Contrivances againſt the Author for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retry,</hi> and No body knows what. And now too, <hi>have at his Rectory,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof, (which he holds by the Law of the Land, and <hi>will hold,</hi> in ſpight of their teeth and malice.)</p>
                     <p>For if ſuch ſolemnizing Matrimony were prov'd upon him in a lawful Court and Judicature, and <hi>againſt lawful Canons and Conſtitutions</hi> found upon Record, and in a <hi>Court of Record,</hi> (but this Court <hi>(if it be a Court</hi>) is <hi>no Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord)</hi> and a true Copy thereof here produced and teſtified:</p>
                     <p>And <hi>alſo if it be prov'd</hi> that ſuch <hi>Canons and Conſtitutions (ſo contrary to one another)</hi> are <hi>(or which of them are)</hi> now in force in theſe days, that the 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. (by which they had enargie, life and power) is defeated; and alſo by the ſaid 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.11. and 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <p>Yet, <hi>even then</hi> the malice of this Defendants Adverſaries <hi>cannot reach his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and the Profits</hi> thereof (as <hi>Thomas Doughty</hi> threatens in the eighth and laſt Article:) for, not only the Injunctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ordains Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (only) <hi>ab officio,</hi> but that Suſpenſion <hi>(in general terms)</hi> in the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>Oh! but the ſaid Promoter <hi>Thomas Doughty</hi> in this laſt Article <hi>cannot afford ſo much clemency;</hi> (it is a pity therefore he ſhould ever be called <hi>veſtra clementia,</hi> or <hi>his Grace</hi>) mercy is (an Herb) rarely found in the Fields of an <hi>Informer</hi> or <hi>Promoter—Solomon</hi> tells us—The <hi>mercies</hi> of <hi>the wicked are cruelty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, <hi>whatever</hi> may be prov'd againſt him in this mighty caſe, he doubts not but to <hi>keep his</hi> Free-holds, Lands and Tenements, <hi>both ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> which (bleſſed be God) <hi>are worth the gaping for;</hi> and let them gape, they may gape <hi>long enough</hi> before they <hi>ſtop their mouths</hi> with them; 'tis to be hoped, their mouths will be <hi>ſtopt with mould</hi> (firſt) <hi>in the grave,</hi> before they ruin a Man and his Houſe; a Man and his Family; a Man and his dear Wife and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven luſty Children; (<hi>God bleſs them</hi> and keep them <hi>out of harms-way,</hi> ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of the Law, againſt all Conſpirators, againſt this Defendant, or them, and againſt all Man-Catchers, <hi>little and great: we live in jolly times,</hi> God keep us.)</p>

                     <p>For the Canons had been left <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> (as all other things were not mentioned in the ſaid Act) <hi>although not one word</hi> concerning them had been therein mentioned.</p>
                     <p>In all Grammatical Conſtruction <hi>(then)</hi> the <hi>Not-confirming the</hi> Lambeth-<hi>Canons,</hi> or Canons of 40, <hi>&amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>Eſpecially, <hi>leaving things as they were in the year</hi> 1639. when the High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court was up; and 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. in force, which is abſolutely <hi>repeal'd</hi> by the ſame Statute; And if any man thought that <hi>ſome had got</hi> (by that 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>an Act for their Turn,</hi> as was endeavor'd, they were vilely miſtaken, or out-witted; at leaſt, it was all that would <hi>(even then)</hi> be done for them; which latter is moſt probable, becauſe of that <hi>fatal miſtake</hi> in repealing 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. And there never was ſuch an Act in the world, nor any made in that year, that this Defendant can find; ſo laſting were the deep and bloody Prints of the High Commiſſion <hi>(even yet)</hi> in Parliament-mens heads.</p>
                     <p>And this, many took notice of long ago, if they had thought it meet and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to take notice of it; it might have been amended, <hi>and may yet</hi> by an Act of Parliament, otherwiſe, it is <hi>to be feared, that the miſtake is fatal;</hi> And the 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.11. be in force, and <hi>not poſſible to be repealed</hi> by the repeal of the 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Then <hi>good-night, Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>there's an end of the Story;</hi> and a Commiſſary, Official or Regiſter's place, is <hi>not worth the buying;</hi> no, <hi>nor that,</hi> of a poor <hi>Proctor of this Court of Arches,</hi> which uſe to coſt <hi>about</hi> 40 l. though the ſame man be a Proctor in any other Spiritual-Court; yet he <hi>cannot practice</hi> in this Court, without laying down the Caſh, (I mean) <hi>down with their Duſt,</hi> Gold Duſt, or <hi>Guinees, Money, more Money.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which (perhaps) is the reaſon, why the Proctors <hi>are ſuffered</hi> to take <hi>ten groats</hi> for a <hi>Fee,</hi> that uſed to be (by the ſtyle of this Court) but and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52560:26"/>proportinably, <hi>all other Fees</hi> abominably enhanc't; <hi>wherever the fault lies,</hi> they <hi>that buy muſt ſell,</hi> or elſe, they have a bad bargain.</p>
                     <p>The Fees of an Excommunication and Abſolution uſed to be but but now they are (this Defendant <hi>knows, to his cost,</hi> and by woful experience, a <hi>Guiney</hi>) but note by the way,
<note place="margin">This alſo is added, <hi>de novo.</hi>
                        </note> the ſaid Biſhops Vice-Regiſter, <hi>Nucourt,</hi> is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in an <hi>Indebitatus-aſſumpſit,</hi> and will alſo have an Indictment, or Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brought againſt him for the <hi>Extortion,</hi> at the <hi>Suit of this Defendant,</hi> who is vilely loth to be <hi>chous't</hi> of his Money, and <hi>by a pitiful Proctor</hi> and <hi>Vice-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>So that, by this time, this Deſendant <hi>is come a great way</hi> towards the final Anſwer of theſe Articles (in this Spiritual-Court) if there were 1000 more of them: eſpecially in a Court that will <hi>neither ſhow, (nor pretend to ſit</hi> by a) Commiſſion from the <hi>King.</hi>

                     <p>But our gracious Sovereign, (<hi>not only in his laſt</hi> Declaration, <hi>but always</hi>) has declared, That he will <hi>rule us according to His Oath and the Fundamental Laws,</hi> made by <hi>the only Legiſlative-power,</hi> the King and Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And the Kings of <hi>England always have been of right,</hi> and always <hi>were</hi> (except <hi>during the Pope's Supremacy</hi>) <hi>equally Heads, or Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as of the <hi>State;</hi> (<hi>if they be two</hi> things.)</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>far be it from the modeſty of this Defendant to pry into the Cover'd Ark,</hi> and ſearch <hi>into the Prerogative</hi> of His gracious Majeſty, (the <hi>Kingdoms glory</hi> as well as <hi>ſupport,</hi> both for his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> our <hi>dear and dread</hi> Sovereign, and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Head</hi> of the Church and State) <hi>which Prerogative</hi> His Majeſty, and his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bleſſed Memory,</hi> our <hi>late Martyr'd</hi> Soveraign, have explain'd to conſiſt (<hi>not only well,</hi> but) <hi>beſt</hi> with <hi>their Peoples Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties;</hi> making a ſweet Harmony, and enriching both King and People; as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> found, that never had an Exchequer <hi>ſooner emptied than filled,</hi> though <hi>her Wars,</hi> and Enemies <hi>were Great</hi> and <hi>Powerful:</hi> She ſometimes <hi>forgave</hi> and <hi>remitted</hi> what was given her by her Subjects in Parliament, but <hi>never made a Speech</hi> or <hi>Motion for Money,</hi> that prov'd <hi>ſucceſsleſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of which,</hi> this Defendant had (<hi>not now</hi> and <hi>here</hi>) taken notice of, <hi>further</hi> than to ſhow (in this his Defence) in reference to the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the ſame, that the ſaid <hi>Queen</hi> never made any Canons, (neither did King <hi>James</hi> make any <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> for the Church or its Regulation) <hi>until her Majeſty,</hi> and conſequently his Majeſty King <hi>James</hi> had (by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and in that Statute) <hi>given</hi> unto her, and them, her Heirs and Succeſſors, <hi>Power</hi> to Amend, Reform, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, <hi>no more then needed at that time,</hi> when the Clergy in Convocation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (and <hi>ſurely they knew their own ſtrength,</hi> as well and <hi>much better</hi> than any <hi>can</hi> do <hi>at this diſtance</hi>) and confeſt in the Statute, 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. that they <hi>had no Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,</hi> and therefore not Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but ſhe in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. reſtor'd it; (namely the old Popiſh Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) until 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, 'tis evident in <hi>Cawdrey's-Caſe,</hi> (in <hi>Cookes Reports,</hi>) that <hi>the Jury</hi> were forc't to find the ſaid <hi>High-Commiſſion ſpecially</hi> (and ſo muſt other Juries do (as well) if <hi>ever the right</hi> of the Spiritual-Courts in Sequeſtrations, Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Deprivations, in medling with mens <hi>Carnal Goods</hi> and <hi>Free-holds,</hi> comes to be tryed in the King-Courts by a Jury (if they can at this time a day) find ſuch a High-Commiſſion, which will be a difficult thing to perſuade a Jury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,) except ſuch Suſpenſion, or Sequeſtration, or Deprivation be ſupported by that which can only ſupport them, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Statute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they ſhould not need to have found the ſaid High-Commiſſion <hi>ſpecially,</hi> if Eccleſiaſtical-Courts then had (or conſequently have) an ordinary Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52560:26"/>without ſpecial Commiſſion from the King, <hi>only and equally</hi> the Head of the <hi>Church and State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But no Temporal-Courts (or Judges) do or dare Act implicitely, but by ſpecial Patents, (or Commiſſions under Seal: (for as for <hi>Hundred-Courts,</hi> they belong to Proprietors; but all derived <hi>originally</hi> by Patents from the Crown, as <hi>Sheriff-Courts</hi> and <hi>Corporation-Courts.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>And beſides, from theſe Inferior Courts, or <hi>Common-Law-Courts,</hi> as are the <hi>Hundred-Courts;</hi> they ſit in <hi>the Hundred by Preſcription;</hi> where the Biſhops alſo uſed to ſit and keep their Courts together, and at the ſame time and place; which if they do not now ſo, they cannot plead to hold Courts by Preſcription, except they (as does (to this day) the <hi>Hundred-Courts</hi> and <hi>County-Courts</hi>) keep up, and keep to their Preſcriptions, as to place and time, Canons and Laws.</p>
                     <p>Therefore away with all idle thoughts of making the Spiritual-Courts, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or Comnion-Law-Courts; this Court it ſelf, (the Supreme of all the Spiritual-Courts) cannot preſcribe for ſitting here in <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> beyond the memory of man, for it us'd to be kept in the <hi>Arches</hi> of <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> whence it had its name, (but now moſt improperly,) except it ſit by ſpecial Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Majeſty, and be ſo ſtyled in the Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>And if the Arch-Biſhop have ſuch Patent from the King to keep Courts of <hi>Judicature-Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as have the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> for keeping <hi>Courts-Temporal,</hi> this Defendant deſires this Court then <hi>ſo to Declare it,</hi> that he may the better know how to demean himſelf with all humility and ſubmiſſion thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But this Defendant has taken the Oath of Supremacy, and dare not own any other Head of the Church, or Eccleſiaſtical Judicature, but what is derived from Him, <hi>in whom alone</hi> is inherent <hi>all the Executive power in Church and State;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>from Him imparted</hi> and derived to the Judges under Him.</p>
                     <p>Nay, when His Majeſty has derived ſuch power to His Judges, yet they <hi>cannot make a Deputy,</hi> if they be ſick, <hi>nor an Official or Surrogate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed ſometimes a Serjeant at Law is ſurrogated, (in the room of one of the 12 Judges, ſick, dead, or otherwiſe avocated) and goes the Circuit; but this muſt be done by <hi>Special Commiſſion,</hi> and his Name ſpecially inſerted and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned therein, <hi>no Judge can make ſuch a Surrogate</hi> or Deputy;</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it is but onely <hi>pro eo vice,</hi> for that turn only.</p>
                     <p>And though an Archbiſhop (with his Archbiſhoprick) and Biſhop (with his Biſhoprick) (if conſtituted according to Law) have all Priviledges alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed anciently, and of right belonging thereunto by Preſcription, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: yet <hi>a Right by Preſcription</hi> and Cuſtom, or Common Law, <hi>is loſt,</hi> when the <hi>Custom ſurceaſes,</hi> and other <hi>new Cuſtoms innovated;</hi> for Cuſtoms ought to be certain, uninterrupted and continual, both as to time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus a <hi>Court-leet</hi> may be loſt and forfeited for want of Uſe, according to the ancient Uſage; and, perhaps, this is (alſo) part of the Caſe.</p>

                     <p>But (here is the unſuitableneſs betwixt our Times, and thoſe Times) they (like the Primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) took the bleſſed Sacrament (in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals) <hi>every day;</hi> and in all Countrey-Churches, <hi>on every Sunday and Holy-day, Wedneſdays and Fridays,</hi> (on which days onely the Communion Service was to be read) nor was it wholly read, but when the Holy Sacrament was adminiſtred, (which was uſually every Sunday and Holyday, in Country Churches and in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals every day) and then read after the Letany; and when the Letany was read, then (and not till then) the Prieſt put on the Surplice, or <hi>Albe</hi> and <hi>Cope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though no man is enjoined by that Act of Uniformity and Common-Prayer Book, to receive the bleſſed Sacrament above once a year, yet the <hi>Houſholds</hi> in the Pariſh (the Rubrick ſays) were ſo order'd, that one at leaſt <hi>(as his turn came)</hi> always communicated with the Prieſt, <hi>one or other,</hi> every Sunday or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day, at the Altar, where the Prieſt ſtood, whil'ſt he read the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Chancel, and might well enough be heard by the Communicants, who all were in the Chancel.</p>
                     <p>This is to ſhew, there is not the ſame reaſon now adays (when the Holy Communion is ſo ſeldom celebrated, no, not in Cathedrals) as it was wont, when the Rubrick (of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.) enjoined the Communion Service to be read at the Altar; for ſo is the Communion Table there ſtiled, in that Book, ſaid by Statute Law, to be compoſed, tranſlated or made by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Again, To give another Example of the conſtant and wilful tranſgreſſion of the Act of Uniformity, by the <hi>Biſhops and Clergy eſpecially:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Namely, In the Rubrick before the order of Morning Prayer, we find theſe words—namely—<hi>And here is to be noted, That ſuch Ornaments of the Church and of the Miniſters thereof at all times of their Miniſtration, ſhall be retained and be in uſe,</hi> (mark that) <hi>as were in this Church of</hi> England <hi>by Authority of Parliament, in the ſecond year of the Reign of King</hi> Edward VI.</p>
                     <p>Now the great Queſtion will be, <hi>What Ornaments they were that were in uſe in the Reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A queſtion that (I hope) few Countrey or City Clergy-men of <hi>ordinary Rank,</hi> know how to anſwer; for it is to be hoped that they ſin through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and not through ſtubbornneſs, and contempt of the Act of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> and are rather ignorant <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> than wilful <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> in uſing other Rites and Ceremonies, and other Ornaments, at all times of their Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than what were in uſe in the time of the 2d of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, enjoined by Act of Parliament. For in the Rubrick in the Communion Service made in the ſaid 2d of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, after the Title, (which is in theſe very words) — <hi>The Supper of the Lord, and the Holy Communion, commonly called the MASSE.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have this Commandment, namely, <q>Upon the day, and at the time appointed for the miniſtration of the Holy Communion, the Prieſt that ſhall execute the Holy Miniſtery, ſhall put upon him the Veſture appointed for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52560:27"/>that Miniſtration, that is to ſay, <hi>A white Albe plain,</hi> with a Veſtment or <hi>Cope!</hi> And where there be many Prieſts or Deacons, there ſo many ſhall be ready to help the Prieſt in the Miniſtration, as ſhall be requiſite; And ſhall have upon them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Veſtures appointed for their Miniſtry, that is to ſay, <hi>Albes with Tunicles.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And (to make the matter plainer) in the Act for the Uniformity of Common-Prayer and Service in the Church, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is enacted, That every manner of Parſon, Vicar, or other whatſoever Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that ought or ſhould ſing or ſay Common-Prayer, mentioned in the ſaid Book, or miniſter the Sacraments, &amp;c. ſhall miniſter the ſame in ſuch order and form</hi> (mark that) <hi>as they be mentioned and ſet forth in the ſaid Book.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Penalties</hi> for the firſt Offence, The profit (of the Benefice, Benefices, and all the <hi>Spiritual Benefits</hi> and Promotions, the Offender hath (for <hi>one Year</hi> next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conviction) is thereby forfeited and gone; together with <hi>ſix Months Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without Bail or Mainpriſe.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond Offence, Deprivation <hi>ipſo facta</hi> of all the Spiritual Promotions, and <hi>one whole Years</hi> Impriſonment; and that it ſhall be lawful for all Patrons and Donors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>collate</hi> to the ſame, as if the Offenders were <hi>really dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the third Offence, Deprivation (as aforeſaid) and Impriſonment during Life.</p>
                     <p>And if the Offender be not <hi>benefic'd</hi> or promoted, for the firſt Offence, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment</hi> for one year without Bayl.</p>
                     <p>And for the ſecond Offence, <hi>Impriſonment during Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So 14 <hi>Car.</hi> II, there is an Act of Uniformity, that (to the ſame effect) enjoyns <hi>no other Rite, Ceremony,</hi> Form or Order of Common-Prayer, Ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is mentioned to humble the rigid Conformiſt, that he do not <hi>plume himſelf and be exalted above meaſure over other Nonconformiſts,</hi> without any Mercy or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to human Nature, human Frailty, human Error and human Kind; leſt he himſelf by the next Grand Jury be preſented, and found guilty of <hi>uſing other Rites</hi> and Ceremonies, than what are enjoyned in the Act of Uniformity and Common-Prayer-Book of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI, or this Common-Prayer-Book;</p>
                     <p>And conſequently, <hi>get a Priſon</hi> on his back, <hi>the ſame Priſon</hi> whereinto he has ſo often endeavoured to put <hi>other Nonconformiſts;</hi> and for the ſame Sin too of Nonconformity, and Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>ſame Act</hi> of Uniformity, that he has ſo extoll'd and cry'd up.</p>
                     <p>For to <hi>bow towards the Altar,</hi> to bow at the Holy <hi>Name of Jeſus,</hi> to force the Inferiour Clergy, except in Cathedrals, to <hi>were the Surplice,</hi> or to wear the Hood, during the Miniſtration of Baptiſm, Burial, Morning-Prayer, Letany, or Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong, are other Rites and Ceremonies, and other Ornaments, than were (forced on) the Clergy to uſe in 2 <hi>Edw. 6th,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, upon the day and at the time <hi>(and only at the time)</hi> of Miniſtration of the Lord's Supper, the Prieſt was enjoyned to put on the <hi>Albe,</hi> or <hi>Surplice and Cope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>not till the Letany was read,</hi> and juſt before he began to read the Common-Service, and adminiſter the Communion at the Altar; for, ſo ſays the Rubrick, in the ſaid Communion-Service in the Common-Prayer-Book of 2 <hi>Edw. 6th,</hi> (juſt after the Prayer for fair Weather) in theſe Words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And tho there be none to communicate with the Prieſt, yet theſe days (namely,</hi> Wedneſdays <hi>and</hi> Fridays, <hi>afore-named in the ſaid Rubrick) after the Letany ended, the Prieſt ſhall put upon him a plain</hi> Albe <hi>or</hi> Surplice, <hi>with a</hi> Cope, <hi>and ſay all things at the Altar, appointed to be ſaid at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, until after the Offertory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that <hi>all are Nonconformiſts,</hi> and liable to Indictments, and loſs of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as well as loſs of their Livings, that pray before or after Sermon, <hi>in other Form or Order,</hi> than is ſet down in the Common-Prayer-Book.</p>

                     <p>
                        <q>In the ſaying or ſinging of Mattens and Even-ſong, Baptizing, and Burying, the Miniſters in Pariſh-Churches and Chappels annexed to the ſame, <hi>ſhall (I ſuppoſe it ſhould have been printed—may)</hi> uſe a Surplice; and in all Cathedral-Churches, and Colledges, the Arch-Deacons, Deans, Provoſts, Maſters, Prebendaries, and Fellows, being Graduates, <hi>may</hi> (<hi>here it is</hi> may, <hi>not</hi> ſhall) uſe in the Quire, beſides their Surplices, ſuch Hoods, as pertaineth to their ſeveral degrees, which they have taken in any Univerſity within this Realm. But in all other places <hi>(mark that)</hi> every Miniſter ſhall be <hi>at Liberty</hi> to uſe any Surplice, <hi>or no.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is alſo <hi>ſeemly</hi> that Graduates when they do preach <hi>(mark that)</hi> ſhould uſe ſuch Hoods as pertaineth to their ſeveral Degrees.</q> So that to wear the <hi>Surplice or no,</hi> is left to <hi>every Man's Liberty,</hi> (even in Cathedrals) eſpecially, <hi>in all other places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hoods according to the degree (not in time of Divine-Service, as in many Cities and Country-places, worn, not for want of Ignorance, but) only may be worn in preaching the Sermon, (upon the Knowledg of a Man's Degree and Quality, may recommend the Sermon poſſibly, and poſſibly not) the Hood is <hi>commended,</hi> not <hi>commanded</hi> to be worn, but the reaſon ceaſes in reading Divine-Service, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Sacraments, or reading of Homilies (which are the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> not <hi>our own works</hi>) and are not (nor need to be) recommended by the Dignity of the Reader, or Adminiſtrator; and therefore <hi>Hoods</hi> (worn at any time, except Sermon-time) and Surplices forc'd upon Mens backs in reading Mattens, Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Song, Baptizings, or Burials, whether they will or no, and not leaving Men at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is [enjoining] other Rites and Ceremonies than what the Law enjoyns, as well as <hi>bowing at the Name of Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>bowing towards the Altar;</hi> a place, which ſome Men never paſs by, but they <hi>bow; they ought to loſe their Spiritual Promotions</hi> for ſuch Superſtition; and <hi>good reaſon,</hi> for it is either <hi>Folly,</hi> or (worſe) <hi>Popiſh Superſtition.</hi> For, if he that bows (ſtill) as he goes by (or approaches) the Altar, does not fancy that there is <hi>ſomewhat extraordinary there</hi> (that exacts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this extraordinary Reverence) <hi>above other places,</hi> then he is a <hi>fooliſh Coxcomb,</hi> to <hi>beck</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> only to that place (above all other) for <hi>no reaſon,</hi> or for <hi>nothing.</hi> But if he doth believe <hi>there is ſomething</hi> plac'd there, that <hi>requires this Reverence</hi> (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> aſſert) who can excuſe him from the belief of that Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> Alſo all are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that adminiſter the Sacrament <hi>without Copes on,</hi> and this makes all the Miniſters in <hi>England Nonconformiſts:</hi> for no body wears Copes, and moſt wear Surplices, tho this Defendant has not worn one (except at Communion-times) for ſeveral Years by-paſt: And a <hi>Cope</hi> he would wear at ſuch time only of celebrating the Lord's Supper, but he cannot get one, <hi>&amp; neceſſitas vincit Legem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this Inſtance he hath been the more copious, to ſhow how little thoſe <hi>Boanarges</hi> or Sons <hi>of Thunder</hi> do obſerve, how they <hi>thunder out their own</hi> Sentence and Condemnation; <hi>Out of thine own mouth will I judg thee, thou wicked Servant!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When nothing but Hell and Damnation, Goals and Excommunications, Fines and Confiſcations, Suſpenſions and Deprivations, will ſerve their turns, for every little Breach of any Clauſe in the Rubrick, and where no harm enſues, nor loſs, (but <hi>gain to the People</hi>) when they are perhaps married <hi>without Banes or Licence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for Men to ſay, that bowing at the Name of the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> our bleſſed Redeemer, is <hi>an harmleſs Ceremony,</hi> aggravates the Offence.</p>
                     <p>It is the Popiſh Excuſe for all their multiplied Ceremonies, ſo many that their Religion is little elſe; or ſo miſerably covered therewith, that Men can ſee little elſe.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52560:28"/>
                     <p> To bow at the Name of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the greateſt of all Names, is <hi>harmleſs;</hi> but it would be <hi>endleſs</hi> to do it; and there is no Scripture to vouch theſe Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> or GOD, &amp;c. as is (hitherto unanſwerably) proved in the laſt page, ſave two, of the <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> the ſecond Part.</p>
                     <p>To wear two or ten Surplices (eſpecially in cold weather) together with an Hood about the Neck, are harmleſs, and the Hood keeps the Neck warm in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but is <hi>too hot</hi> in all conſcience in Summer-time: but if it were not too hot, nor yet too heavy; yet ſtill they are <hi>other Rites and Ceremonies</hi> than are enjoined in the Act for Uniformity; and therefore <hi>puniſhable and unlawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what can or dare theſe Rigid Conformiſts anſwer in their own defence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and confeſs their Ignorance?</p>
                     <p>Let us pray for them in our bleſſed Saviour's words, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do!</hi> For certainly the Law <hi>does not forgive them,</hi> but is clear againſt them; What can they ſay for themſelves <hi>why Judgment ſhould not be given againſt them,</hi> according to their celebrated Act of Uniformity?</p>
                     <p>And to ſay, the Canons enjoin ſome of theſe Ceremonies, much aggravates the Offence; <hi>to play old Canons againſt the King and Parliament's new Acts and Statutes,</hi> this is petulant and unpardonable; (I had almoſt ſaid) They had more need pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for an <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi> to pardon <hi>all Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and to get for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Remiſſion in the Crowd.</p>

                     <p>AGain; The ſaid <hi>Rubrick</hi> ſays, <hi>None ſhall ſolemnize Matrimony without Banes.</hi> But who obſerves it? <hi>who obeys it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do not <hi>Commiſſaries, Officials, Archdeacons, Registers, Vice-Regiſters,</hi> and all that Tribe grant Licences and Faculties, with a <hi>non-obſtante</hi> to the Statute and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick? But with what Forehead, and by what Authority?</p>
                     <p>If the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York</hi> ſhould grant ſuch Licences, or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to diſpence with the Statute, <hi>a little more</hi> might be ſaid for it, if but a little. But for <hi>theſe Fellows</hi> to ſell Indulgences and Diſpenſations to the Statute, where's the Modeſty, or rather the Impudence? The very ſame <hi>Rubrick</hi> is in the Common-Prayer-Book of 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. For the ſaid Statute gives <hi>no Privilege,</hi> no Exception, no Diſpenſation <hi>to any Man</hi> to ſolemnize Matrimony without Banes, ſolemnly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed three ſeveral Sundays or Holy-days, in time of Divine Service, where <hi>there are Churches, and Divine Service ſaid</hi> in ſuch Pariſhes where the Parties inhabit; otherwiſe, they cannot be married without breach of the ſaid Act, or Rubrick; (except perhaps in that impediment) becauſe <hi>Neceſſitas vincit Legent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And truly Matrimony (tho <hi>not a Sacrament</hi>) yet is ſo ſerious a thing, ſo laſting when the Knot is once tied by a Prieſt, <hi>ever laſting during Life,</hi> that the Law could not ſafely have been made otherwiſe than by commanding ſuch a ſolemn <hi>previous Publication in open Church,</hi> in the Pariſhes where the Parties inhabit, three ſeveral Sundays, or Holy-days.</p>
                     <p>And then there could be <hi>no ſtoln-Weddings,</hi> nor Infants trepann'd into Marriage without the conſent of their Parents and Governors. A <hi>Caution</hi> that even in the times of the late Uſurpation was taken care for, when the Juſtices of Peace did the Jobb.</p>
                     <p>And for Regiſters and Surrogates, &amp;c. to take upon them to take Bond of 100 <hi>l.</hi> is ſo ſmall a Penalty, and the Bond ſo unwarrantable in Law, that it ſignifies juſt nothing; but to give a Man an Oath, in the caſe, is altogether illegal, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable. However it is <hi>contrary to Law</hi> in the ſaid Rubrick: But what <hi>ſhall be the Penalty?</hi> The Judges <hi>(alone)</hi> ſhall determine, according to the <hi>evil Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> and evil Conſquences thereof.</p>

                     <p>

To which this Defendant particularly anſwereth, and ſaith, That all the aforeſaid five Couples are <hi>poor People,</hi> that either live in Pariſhes where there is <hi>no Church,</hi> (but what is demoliſhed) as are the Churches of St. <hi>Bottolph</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> aforeſaid, and no <hi>Cure</hi> at all ſerv'd there, ſince the Siege of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> or <hi>elſe no conſtant Cure ſerved</hi> for the ſpace of a <hi>month and more</hi> together, as at the time when the ſaid <hi>Potter</hi> of <hi>Aldham,</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and the reſt of St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s were married, and conſequently no Banes could <hi>be publiſhed</hi> in time of Divine Service, where there is no Divine Service: nor any Profits belonging to the Church of St. <hi>Bottolph</hi>'s, or St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> aforeſaid, that ever he heard of, (if the Churches were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and ſo <hi>little</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s as aforeſaid, that they have had no Miniſter ſometimes for <hi>two or three Years together,</hi> nor did any body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it or take care of it, for two or three Years together, till Mr. <hi>Sewell</hi> aforeſaid, took ſome care of it; and if he deſert the ſame, they'll be juſt ſerved as formerly, <hi>Canis in Preſepi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the ſaid People (who told this Defendant they had not the gift of Continency) and therefore (Marriage being the <hi>only</hi> lawful remedy) they were loth to come together and lye together <hi>unmarried,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> they had none to ſpare for a Licence, and (if they had) this Defendant had equally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd the Statute, if he had marryed them (with any pretended Licence) except the Banes had been three times publiſhed, three ſeveral Sundays, or Holy-Days, in time of Divine-Service, which was impoſſible, <hi>&amp; neceſſitas vincit Legem,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And this Court had had this Anſwer <hi>ſooner,</hi> but that this Defendant could not in ſafety or without <hi>Affronts</hi> approach your Courts, having been there <hi>but twice,</hi> and both times by your Clerks, <hi>Vaſſals</hi> and Rabble, without any <hi>regard or Reverence</hi> to his Quality, or the Dignity of his Function, <hi>aſſaulted,</hi> affronted and threatned.</p>
                     <p>And had he not accidentally, and <hi>(by good Providence)</hi> had a great number of Subſtantial Citizens (thither brought perhaps through Curioſity, (eſpecially the <hi>firſt time</hi>) of his appearance, and followed him out of your Court) miſchief <hi>(much miſchief)</hi> might have been done.</p>
                     <p>Yet, <hi>even then,</hi> your Creatures, (unprovok'd) did with <hi>moſt inſolent and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious</hi> Language, and Threatnings, <hi>purſue this Defendant and the ſaid Citizens,</hi> out of the Gates of <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> into the Street, and there ſhamefully <hi>rail'd</hi> and <hi>ſcolded,</hi> till we were out of <hi>hearing.</hi>

                     <p>There are <hi>none of his Majeſties Courts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but both for <hi>their own</hi> and <hi>his Majeſties Honour,</hi> will not only <hi>keep the Peace,</hi> but a <hi>Decorum,</hi> and will protect thoſe eſpecially <hi>that they ſummon</hi> before them, from Affronts.</p>

                     <p>To whom this Defendant is willingly ſubject in <hi>licitis &amp; honeſtis,</hi> (only) and not in things unbecoming a Gentleman, a Clergy-man, and an Engliſh-man.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>One Blunder more</hi> is yet behind (which this Defendant had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got) namely, That when the ſaid Promoter <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſeems to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist,</hi> and give over the Promotion and Proſecution, in the end of the 7th <hi>Article,</hi> as being probably <hi>weary of the Preferment,</hi> to which his Vice-Regiſter, the ſaid <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> ſo ſawcily promoted him unto, without his Privity (as is conjectured); or perhaps weary of the Proſecution, <hi>fore-ſeeing the Anſwers and Reaſons</hi> already here alleaged; But when this Defendant was <hi>in hopes</hi> the worſt had been paſt, then in the 8th <hi>Article</hi> up ſtarts <hi>Doughty</hi> (the old Promoter) <hi>again,</hi> and threatens; (what the ſaid Biſhop probably would have ſcorn'd to do;) for the ſaid <hi>Thomas Doughty</hi> recovering his place again (of which the ſaid <hi>Nucourt</hi> had really deprived him) <hi>takes up the Gantlet</hi> again, and threatens to take from this Defendant his ſaid <hi>Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of All-Saints,</hi> a great Eye-ſore <hi>(it ſeems)</hi> to him, and that <hi>for three long Years,</hi> beſides <hi>costs</hi> of Suit.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it is a Threat that does much better become ſuch a <hi>doughty Fellow,</hi> than a <hi>Reverend Divine,</hi> or Biſhop, who ought to endeavour that the <hi>Flock</hi> ſhould be <hi>fed,</hi> not <hi>ſtarv'd,</hi> and to <hi>encourage</hi> the painful Labourers <hi>(that bear the Burden and ſweat of the Day)</hi> and not <hi>ſuſpend,</hi> ſtop their Mouths, or <hi>Handcuff</hi> them; but to remember that what Power he has, ſhould be employed to the utmoſt for <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and <hi>not for Deſtruction,</hi> to do all <hi>the Good</hi> he can, <hi>not all the Miſchief</hi> he can.</p>

                     <p>But above all, <hi>'tis incomparable,</hi> that Regiſters, Commiſſaries, Officials, and ſuch <hi>kind of Creatures,</hi> ſhould make <hi>ſuch a noiſe</hi> about marrying People <hi>without the ſtrict Rituals</hi> of the Church (<hi>which they break every day,</hi> by granting Licences publickly in defiance of the Statute) and pronouce ſuch <hi>Solemnization</hi> of Matrimony a <hi>Prophanation!</hi> How do they paſs Sentence againſt themſelves? as if <hi>the Children</hi> of all that were married <hi>without Banes</hi> by their Licences, and Indulgences, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Ritual and punctilio</hi> of the Statute of <hi>

                        <q>He was a devout Chriſtian, a ſincere Proteſtant, and a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (<hi>and yet he had been one of</hi> Oliver Cromwell<hi>'s Judges of the Common-Pleas</hi>) moderate towards Diſſenters, and juſt even to thoſe from whom he differ'd moſt; which appeared ſignally in the care he took, in a Caſe of the Quakers; wherein he was very cautious <hi>(mark that)</hi> in declaring their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages void, and ſo baſtarding their Children.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But he conſider'd <hi>Marriage</hi> and Succeſſion as <hi>a Right of Nature,</hi> from which <hi>none ought to be barred,</hi> what miſtakes ſo ever they might be under in point of <hi>revealed</hi> Religion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And therefore in a Trial that was before him, when a <hi>Quaker</hi> was ſued for ſome Debts, owing by his Wife before he married her; and the <hi>Quaker's Counſel</hi> pretended, <hi>That it was no Marriage that had paſt between them, ſince it was not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized according to the Rules of the Church of</hi> England.</q>
                     </p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52560:31"/>Baſtards,</hi> and gave Directions to the <hi>Jury,</hi> to find it <hi>ſpecial,</hi> which they did.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It was a Reflection on the whole Party, that one of them, to avoid an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience he had fallen in, thought to have preſerved himſelf by a Defence, that if this Judg had abſolutely determin'd, muſt have made their whole Iſſue Baſtards, and incapable of Succeſſion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And for all their pretended Friendſhip to one another, if the Judg had not been more <hi>their Friend,</hi> than <hi>one</hi> of thoſe <hi>ſo called,</hi> their Poſterity had been little beholden to them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But he govern'd himſelf indeed by the Law of the Goſpel, of doing to others what he would have others do to him:</q> 
                        <hi>Which Law vacuates and makes null and void all Laws of Man,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>that are made to the contrary, as being againſt the Law of God and the Law of Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And therefore becauſe he would have thought it a <hi>Hardſhip, not without a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi> if amongſt Papiſts all Marriages were null'd, which had not been made with <hi>all the Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Roman Ritual;</hi> ſo he applying this to the caſe of the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> he thought all <hi>Marriages</hi> made <hi>according</hi> to the <hi>ſeveral Perſwaſions</hi> of Men, ought to have <hi>their Effects in Law.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here was a Man made up of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and had Conſcience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion <hi>to human kind</hi> mingled with his Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and was <hi>good</hi> as well as <hi>wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He well foreſaw <hi>what a Rod,</hi> a juſt Rod <hi>we Proteſtants</hi> make for our ſelves, and <hi>(if ever the Papists prevail)</hi> to baſtardize all our Children, if it be a concluded Maxime of the Church and Law of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>every omiſſion,</hi> or want of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Rituals</hi> in the ſolemnization of Matrimony, make it null; <hi>Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Right in Nature,</hi> and obſerved amongſt Heathens (where I have inhabited and dwelt) that never heard or regarded any other Religion than the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> And tho one Man, may (if he can manage them, or think that he has <hi>not enough of One</hi>) if he pleaſe, and alſo if another Woman agree to it, he may take her to Wife, and as many as he can, in addition: But <hi>Adultery is never heard of amongst them,</hi> at leaſt more rarely than in <hi>Courts Chriſtian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I hope both I and <hi>all my Country-men</hi> (true-hearted Engliſh-men and Proteſtants) will have <hi>more cauſe</hi> to rejoice, than <hi>Court Christian,</hi> that ever they royl'd or <hi>provok'd my lazy and beloved Silence,</hi> Retiredneſs and Privacy, by ſo <hi>ſilly an occaſion,</hi> to <hi>publiſh</hi> thus my Thoughts and Meditations on <hi>greater Matters:</hi> But ſuch is the Policy; when I had begg'd of Sir <hi>Thomas Exton</hi> (my old Friend and Acquaintance) as if it had been for an Alms, more than once, (which they igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly conſtrued to proceed <hi>from fear</hi> of them) That he would ſpeak to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to withdraw the Proſecution and Promotion, and <hi>not force me to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> what I knew would (and which I was loth ſhould) be diſpleaſing to them.</p>

                     <p>But if nothing will ſerve men, but <hi>ſevere Remarks</hi> muſt be made on <hi>ſuch Seditious</hi> or Schiſmaticks, (by what has been ſaid) you ſee we muſt all cry, guilty, <hi>from the higheſt to the loweſt,</hi> Clergy and Laity, that have but bow'd at the Name of Jeſus, or to the Altar, or ſet up everlaſting Candles thereon; for the Papiſts light them, and burn them upon the Altar, in imitation; for moſt of their Religion is only <hi>Apiſh Mymicry</hi> of the Primitive Times and Chriſtians, who were glad (becauſe of Perſecution) to meet in private Conventicles, in <hi>Cells</hi> and <hi>Cellars,</hi> and by ſtealth in the <hi>Night,</hi> and conſequently did all (as the Papiſts now do uſually at <hi>Noon-day</hi> in their chiefeſt Churches, they obſcure the Windows with Hangings, and do all <hi>(perhaps in fee with the Chandlers)</hi> by Candle-light, or thinking as ſome idle Trades-men do (that burn the day) that <hi>bought Light is beſt.</hi>

                     <p>But we may as <hi>rationally</hi> quarrel with every Man we meet, whoſe Noſe of his Face is longer or ſhorter, leſſer or bigger than our own; as to quarrel <hi>thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly</hi> and to <hi>Daggers-drawing,</hi> about different Judgments and Opinions, in Men whoſe Heads and Eyes are <hi>not all of a ſize and accuracy,</hi> to the ſhameful Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Peace of Chriſtendom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And for all this,</hi> We may thank the Avarice and Ambition of <hi>Rome and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> that pretend to be the <hi>only Ring-leaders to Heaven;</hi> and if you will not come along with them, they'll curſe and damn you, and bid the Devil take you for a Heretick and an Infidel.</p>
                     <p>Whiſt the <hi>Turk laughs in his Sleeve</hi> to ſee how the Proteſtant Chriſtians are forc'd to fly to him for Shelter (as now the <hi>Hungarians</hi> do (called therefore <hi>Rebel Hungarians</hi>) that ſo <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> would pleaſe to defend them and ſave them from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> and his Blood-Hounds, the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A very goodly Account, and ready way to convert the Great <hi>Turk!</hi> So that for my part, I wiſh we may (now) put into our <hi>Letany again,</hi> that which <hi>is</hi> (and <hi>was</hi>) put in by the firſt Reformers and Martyrs, and Compoſers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book and Letany in 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th,) I know not by <hi>what or whoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> (now) <hi>omitted:</hi> Namely, From all Sedition, and privy Conſpiracy; <hi>From the Tyrany of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his deteſtable Enormities;</hi> from all fulſe Doctrine and Hereſy, from Hardneſs of Heart, and Contempt of thy Word and Commandment, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There's <hi>not one word of alteration</hi> in the Letany, from what <hi>it was at firſt,</hi> except in this Suffrage; and ſure 'tis <hi>now</hi> as needful and ſeaſonable a Prayer, as ever it was.</p>
                     <p>For is it not great Tyranny in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, and of all ſuch</hi> as are of like Popiſh Principles, to quarrel with all Men we meet <hi>upon the Road to Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not go our Way? and if Words will not do, then <hi>Blows ſhall,</hi> and then <hi>hale them along,</hi> and curſe them and damn them, excommunicate, and Goal them.

                     <p> A moſt <hi>incomparable Chriſtian Method!</hi> but I'll ſay of ſuch (as <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> 6th, ſaid of his wicked Son <hi>Caeſar Borgias,) me commonſtratore non didicit,</hi> he ne'r learn'd this of his Father: I mean the Father of Spirits, our Heavenly Father never taught them thus to fight and quarrel upon the Road to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Why? ſuppoſe a Man <hi>will not go our way,</hi> or think his Buſineſs rather lies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, a ſhorter cut, <hi>a nearer way</hi> and a better Road.</p>
                     <p>Muſt we, becauſe we think the Man is in an Error and Miſtake, <hi>draw</hi> our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons (whether carnal or ſpiritual) <hi>upon him?</hi> where's the Reaſon, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Chriſtianity of it?</p>
                     <p>Does not every Man beſt underſtand his own <hi>Concern?</hi> or if he doth not, 'tis <hi>not our loſs,</hi> but the harm is <hi>his own:</hi> We may <hi>adviſe him friendlily,</hi> and tell him of the dangerous way he is in, of which yet none of us (the wiſeſt of us) are certainly infallible and aſſured.</p>
                     <p>But if he will not take our Advice, <hi>fare him well,</hi> curſe him not, but <hi>pray for him,</hi> and ſay, <hi>God bleſs him,</hi> and <hi>teach him and us</hi> the right way.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, if our Actions and Manners be againſt the indiſputable and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Laws of God and Nature,</hi> as Blaſphemy, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, and Rebellion, Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>take him Goaler,</hi> and let the Magiſtrate correct him:</p>
                     <p>But to curſe, whip, laſh, ſlaſh, and <hi>Bridewel a Man</hi> for not thinking as we do, (Opinion and Thought being <hi>free,</hi> and impoſſible to be compell'd) is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition, High-Commiſſion, and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tyranny, and a <hi>Lunacy</hi> (to boot) beyond that of <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God grant us to be all of one Heart and Mind in God's Worſhip and Service, and to keep the Unity of the Spirit (at leaſt in the Bond of Peace, and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.) But if (thus) Praying will not do; curſing, and excommunicating and damning ſhould not do I am ſure. Which makes me think of a Gain (and I'll not think it <hi>Battology</hi> to recite it again) namely, That admirable and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like Direction, and (only ſafe) Preſcription of the ſaid Incomparable Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> amongſt his ſaid 18 <hi>Caveats,</hi> given to himſelf, in theſe Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That I be not too rigid in Matters <hi>purely conſcientious,</hi> where all the harm is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Judgment;</hi> and if in Criminals, it be a Meaſuring-caſt, to encline <hi>to Mercy</hi> and Acquittal.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is true Piety indeed, and the only true Chriſtianity; but the contrary, is true Impiety, and the only <hi>true Antichriſtianiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, <hi>'Tis true Policy</hi> too, no Man quarrels with another that is not juſt of his Size, Complexion and Pitch: and why not? Becauſe there's no Law to fine every Man that is not of ſuch a common Standard, Size and Pitch; <hi>if there were,</hi> Covetouſneſs and Tyranny would ſet the Uniform and common Sandard-men at work (if it were but for <hi>the Fine ſake</hi>) to hale in the Nonconformiſts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Scanltings, and then what old tugging and quarrelling, goaling and bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would there be, to the perpetual Diſturbance of the Neighbourhood, and the Kingdom, as well as to the ſhameful Scandal of Chriſtianity, that makes Doves and Lambs indeed, but neither Wolves nor Bloody <hi>Bonners</hi> or Tygers.</p>
                     <p>Whereas now that we have a <hi>general Comprehenſion</hi> as to all Sizes of the Body; and no Man is bound to grow to juſt <hi>ſuch a Scantling,</hi> and no higher; we have no quarrelling about the Matter, no more than there is in <hi>Holland</hi> (about Religion) where, tho they have different Religions, yet every Man being left to God and his Liberty to go to Heaven which way he pleaſe, they never curſe, damn, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or quarrel about the matter, but leave every Man to <hi>ſtand and fall to his own Maſter,</hi> and Creator, further than Chriſtian <hi>Admonitions</hi> and <hi>State-Encouragements</hi> and Preferments do invite or allure.</p>
                     <p>For they admit and courteouſly entertain (like Men and Chriſtians) all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, except the ſaid Inhoſpitable and An<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And to this Severity they are forc'd and conſtrain'd through that Jeſuitical <hi>Maxime,</hi> that <hi>Dominion is founded in Grace,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>All the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> Territories, People and Dominions, ought to be ſubject to <hi>Chriſt's only Vicar, or Vice-Gerent</hi> upon Earth, <hi>the Pope.</hi>

                     <p> For Severity and Cruelty <hi>may make</hi> many Hypocrites, but cannot make one Saint; it can do much Miſchief, when in Power (the only thing that wicked Men mind) but not any Good: it can <hi>ſurrogate to Deſtruction,</hi> but not to <hi>Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> it can (like <hi>Eroſtratus</hi>) get a <hi>Name</hi> and Fame for <hi>deſtroying</hi> the Temple and Church, but wants the Heart of Holy <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>wiſe Head</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to <hi>build the Temple</hi> and Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour came neither to deſtroy the <hi>material or ſpiritual Temple;</hi> but if Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites, deſtroy it, he ſaid, <hi>he could build it again in three days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſome Mens Arts are like the late Biſhop of <hi>London, Bonner,</hi> his Arts; they can deſtroy and fire the Spiritual Temples of God in few days, more than they will erect and build up all their Life-time.</p>

                        <hi>FRiday, Novemb.</hi> 25th, 1681, was the day appointed and agreed upon <hi>(on both ſides)</hi> to <hi>argue the ſaid Pleas,</hi> Proteſtations, and Anſwer; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Sir <hi>Philp Lloyd,</hi> (upon the 21ſt Inſtant, being their Court-day) did <hi>bid me nominate</hi> and chuſe what <hi>Advocates</hi> I thought moſt meet to <hi>argue,</hi> and improve my ſaid Proſteſtations, Pleas, and Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Advocates?</hi> (Replied I) Advocates? <hi>what?</hi> ſhall I ask <hi>Advice of the Fox, how to preſerve my Chickens?</hi> Advocates indeed, have the Advantage of me in Skill, Eloquence, Pleadings, and Subtilties; but all that will be abundantly ſupplied by the Advantage of the Ground on which my Innocence has plac'd me—.<hi>Let Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples go on Crutches,</hi> (I told them) and that I doubted not (by God's help) but I ſhould ſtand on my own Legs, and againſt them all, if I might but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>fair play, and the benefit of the Laws;</hi> which was <hi>fairly promiſed, and honeſtly</hi> performed; yet on the day, time, and place appointed in <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> to argue this mighty Caſe, before the Judg came into the Room, I was moſt <hi>inſolently affronted,</hi> and my <hi>Hat pluck'd off</hi> in great Rudeneſs, and tumultuouſly by a Proctor's Clerk (unworthy the naming) who being reproved for the ſawcy Attempt by ſome Citizens there preſent (all ſtrangers and unknown to me) upon the <hi>Stir,</hi> comes in Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> and inquiring the Cauſe of ſuch Diſturbance and Noiſe, was told by one of the Citizens, and <hi>who</hi> cauſed the ſame.</p>
                     <p>He very honeſtly <hi>check'd and ſeverely chid</hi> the Fellow, and bid him be gone out of the Room, and that otherwiſe he might have been thought <hi>privy,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>countenance ſuch Rudeneſs, when Men come</hi> upon their Affairs, Citations and Moniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (to <hi>Doctors-Commons;</hi>) but that was poor Satisfaction for ſo great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick an Affront; 'tis well we have his Majeſties Laws and his Majeſties Courts to vindicate and ſecure us from ſuch barbarous Aſſaults, and probably the Fellow has heard from me concerning it, before this time.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Interim,</hi> to proceed,—Sir <hi>Philip</hi> takes a Chair and ſits down, and ſo did all the Advocates, and very courteouſly, the Judg deſires me alſo to take a Chair amongſt them, and ſit down; and great Expectation there was by the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders to hear this mighty Argument.</p>
                     <p>But when it came to Sir <hi>Thomas Exton,</hi> (of Counſel for the Promoter) <hi>inſtead of arguing, admitted my Pleas,</hi> and there's an end of an old Song, except at the next Term, the Term Probatory, further Debate, or Debait ariſe; ſo <hi>away I came,</hi> out of their Room with the ſtifling Crowd after me, who were defeated of their hopes to hear ſoome Proof or good Foundation for their Spiritual's Courts, which Sir <hi>Thomas Exton</hi> ſaid, I denied; and my Reaſons for the ſame, you have heard in my Anſwer, which was not <hi>argued,</hi> but <hi>admitted,</hi> and ſo the By-ſtanders <hi>lost their Longing,</hi> as well as <hi>I lost my time,</hi> detain'd for a <hi>Nonni-no</hi> above a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night at <hi>London,</hi> from my Pariſh, my Family, my Cure and Charge.</p>
                     <p>But how I employed my ſelf in that Fortnight, you have read (thus far) in this Book, all writ at <hi>London</hi> in that time; and the next day, coming to <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> weary, and <hi>tir'd and bemir'd,</hi> I immediately (to ſhow my Love to Peace and Quietneſs) writ by <hi>Saturday</hi> Poſt, this following Letter, (to Sir <hi>Thomas Exton</hi>) not amiſs, here to inſert, in theſe very Words.</p>

                     <p>But who <hi>heeds the Canon,</hi> when an uſeful Man, a Man of great Parts, great Improvements, great Learning, and alſo <hi>(which I had almoſt forgot)</hi> great Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends in the Caſe!</p>
                     <p>It was a Canon <hi>(Concil.

                     <p>But notwithſtanding all this, the Church made <hi>bold to crack a Commandment,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> who having great <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> was choſen Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whilſt he was a Souldier, a <hi>Layman,</hi> and <hi>unbaptized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I can tell you, the Patriarch (or Pope) of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> would have ſcorn'd in thoſe days to have <hi>given the Wall to the Pope</hi> of Rome.</p>

                     <p>Lawn-ſleeves then, nor all thoſe Reverend Habits, and Accoutrements of the Biſhops, whether the Moſt Reverend, or the Right Reverend Fathers in God (we ſee by many Experiments) are no infallible Marks or Signs of Truth; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peradventure, as if all <hi>their Placets</hi> muſt, muſt, muſt needs be right, whilſt they are frail like other Mortals,</p>
                     <p>And therefore (Excommunication) like <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Sword is but a common Weapon, except it be wielded by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s <hi>Arm,</hi> Judgment and Dexterity: A <hi>Crieple</hi> would <hi>make</hi> but <hi>bungling work</hi> with it; nay, perhaps <hi>loſe it to the Enemy,</hi> and then we ſhall have it <hi>turn'd upon us fatally.</hi> Good Crieples! ſit ſtill, and be quiet, till you get <hi>Apoſtolical Arms, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Dexterity;</hi> for fear this two-edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sword with which you do ſo cut and hack, diſmember and <hi>mangle the Body</hi> of Chriſt, (for a <hi>Guinee</hi> a cut) be one <hi>day turned</hi> upon your ſelves with the fatal <hi>Edge towards</hi> you, if the Enemy recover it, and get it in his hand again.</p>

Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a Heretick, that is, they deliver him over to Satan (as the Apoſtles did) but finding <hi>Satan would not</hi> take the Excommunicate (as he did in the Apoſtles days) then the Pope (by an <hi>Arrogance</hi> as petulant as the <hi>Sarcaſme</hi>) <hi>ſurrogates the Magiſtrate</hi> (inſtead of Satan) <hi>to take the Excommunicate for the deſtruction of the Fleſh,</hi> (and that in the moſt compendious way) by Fire and Faggot, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fleſh, Body, and Bones in the Flames.</p>
                     <p>And though amongſt us the Heretick ſhall not now be delivered over to the Magiſtrate to be burnt, (ſince the Abolition of the Writ <hi>de Heretico comburendo</hi>) yet even at this day, when holy Church (which <hi>yet confeſſes her ſelf ſubject to error</hi>) ſignifies a Man to be Excommunicate for Hereſy, the Magiſtrate takes him with the

Alas! Cordial Medicines are made for <hi>the very nonce</hi> for the ſick: (as the <hi>Sacraments for ſinners</hi>) and the whole (if there be any ſuch) <hi>have no need of this Phyſick,</hi> but them that are ſick; And if <hi>all ſinners</hi> muſt be deprived of the bleſſed Sacrament, and Excommunicate; I doubt, the Biſhop and his Chancellor, <hi>(that Excommunicate ſinners)</hi> muſt be ſorc't to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>alone by themſelves.</hi>

                     <p>No, quoth <hi>Mahomet, Will you not budg?</hi> then if the Hill will not come to <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi> ſhall budg to the Hill; and ſo fairly <hi>marcht to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not apply it, but this I will ſay, concerning ſome (call'd) Hereticks, that ſeem <hi>ſixt as a Mountain to</hi> their Principles (and who but <hi>Infallible-Sirs</hi> can tell but that <hi>after the way ſome men call Hereſie, ſo Worſhip they the God of their Fathers.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>If theſe <hi>fixed Hereticks will not be removed,</hi> if we had <hi>faith like a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, we could remove theſe mountains</hi> without the <hi>carnal helps</hi> of <hi>Spades, Axes,</hi> and <hi>Pick-axes;</hi> but 'till then, if the Mountains <hi>will not come</hi> to us, nor we ſo ſupple and condeſcending as to <hi>march over</hi> to them, <hi>let them ſtand</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> to their own Maſter, and Creator that there fixt them, except they obey the <hi>firſt, ſecond and third</hi> Admonition.</p>
                     <p>Their Souls are their own, they beſt know on whoſe Errand they go; we have deliver'd our Souls, and done our duty, 'tis they muſt ſuffer, and is it not <hi>puniſhment enough</hi> to loſe Heaven hereafter, but we muſt take their <hi>Purſes upon the High-way thither,</hi> or Goal them, Sequeſter them, Kill and Slay, Fine and Confiſcate; and make them take <hi>Heaven by violence</hi> (in a wrong ſenſe) <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> with Sword and Gun. Is the Church (for this) call'd <hi>Militant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſide, Hereſie is not ſo <hi>ill-natur'd a Word,</hi> as fierce men make it, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor calls Chriſtian Religion Hereſie, (that is) a Sect, or Profeſſion, or Opinion. The Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Acts 5.17. and Sect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Act. 15.5. (in the <hi>Greek</hi> is) of the Hereſie of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who believed. <hi>Non ſum in eadem cum illo Hereſi,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>ſententia,</hi> ſays <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Paradoxes.</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Againſt what Offenders and Offences Excommunication was made uſe of?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>This Sword</hi> of Excommunication was <hi>never drawn</hi> (that we read of) by our Bleſſed Saviour at all; nor yet by his Apoſtles, except that St. <hi>Paul drew it twice;</hi> once againſt an Inceſtuous Perſon, and then afterwards againſt <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for Blaſphemy:</p>
                     <p>Not a Fornicator, nor an Adulterer Excommunicated in thoſe days (more than in our days) nor a Common-ſwearer or Blaſphemer (amongſt them more than amongſt us) Excommunicated, except the ſaid <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> that we read of.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52560:36"/>
                     <p> And theſe by an Apoſtle that <hi>neither bore the ſaid Sword in vain, neither miſtook by nick-naming</hi> the ſin or the ſinner; for he had the <hi>Spirit of Diſcerning,</hi> that we (poor Moles) do want: he <hi>never ſhot at Random,</hi> never miſt, or <hi>ſhot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the</hi> right <hi>Mark;</hi> never made this Sword of the Lord to <hi>Duel</hi> or <hi>Hack</hi> in a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Quarrel</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> much leſs upon <hi>any falſe, unjuſt,</hi> or <hi>illegal ground:</hi> and moſt of all would have <hi>abhorr'd</hi> to have <hi>Coyn'd</hi> with it, or made Money of it.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>How Excommunication (at this day) does agree with the Laws of God, and the Laws of the Land?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. By what has been ſaid, <hi>it does not appear to me</hi> that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes Excommunication a <hi>ſtanding Ordinance</hi> in the Church of the <hi>Old or New Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, that ever any <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was debarr'd (or order'd to be debarr'd) the uſe of the Sacraments, for Moral Uncleanneſs, in Life, Manners, or Opinion, <hi>in the Old Teſtament;</hi> or, any Chriſtian, <hi>in the New.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But herein, I pretend not to be Infallible, nor do I affirm it <hi>peremptorily,</hi> but humbly deſire to be better inform'd of ſuch as ſee more than my ſelf, and of my Superiors: I may be erronious, but never will be obſtinate, or a Heretick.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Poſitive Laws, Human</hi> (ſo that they be <hi>not contrary</hi> to Gods) Law, I have learnt to <hi>obey,</hi> not to <hi>diſpute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I Publiſh this chiefly, that thereby Learned men may take occaſion, to inform and reform my Judgment herein, if it be erronious: But I have nothing to ſay againſt Excommunication ſo far as it is the Law of the Land, and not abus'd.</p>
                     <p>But by what Law of God or Man, the Lay-Doctors, Commiſſaries and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors (without ſo much as the preſence of a Prieſt <hi>for formality ſake</hi>) have got the <hi>power of the Keys,</hi> and to make much Money of them for every trifle, tranſcends my underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>The fifth</hi> Query, <hi>What good or harm Excommunication has done in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. To which I ſhall <hi>briefly Anſwer,</hi> in the words of the Learned Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in his late <hi>Anſwer to Mr.</hi> Dodwell—<hi>p.</hi> 106, 107, 108. (which I chuſe (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour) to quote, chiefly for the <hi>Authority,</hi> and alſo becauſe <hi>I am quite tyred</hi> of this Theame, and will therefore wave at preſent my <hi>own large Collections</hi> (which would ſwell this Book too much) and make them make room for his <hi>far more compendious</hi> Argument in this following <hi>Induction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Nothing but <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Impudence</hi> can deny that the difficulty of knowing whoſe Excommunication it is that is to be dreaded as owned by God, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged profeſſed Chriſtians ſo confuſedly to Excommunicate one another, as that this Excommunication hath been ſo far from conſtraining moſt to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that it hath made Chriſtianity a horrid ſcandal to Infidels and Heathens, by ſetting the Chriſtian World in the odious confuſion of Excommunicating one another.</q> To give ſome inſtances how far Excommunication is not coercive.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who but the Devil was the gainer by Pope <hi>Victor</hi>'s Excommunicating the <hi>Aſians</hi> about <hi>Eaſter-day?</hi> Did it compel them to Obedience?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Orthodox Excommunicated the <hi>Arrians,</hi> did it force them to obey? When they got almoſt all the Biſhops for them, and Excommunicated and deſtroyed their Excommunicators?</p>

                     <p n="4">4. (To paſs forty other Sects) when <hi>Rome</hi> Excommunicated, yea, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the <hi>Novatians,</hi> Did it compel them to obey?

                     <p n="5">5. Did <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Counſel againſt the <hi>Joannites</hi> win them, or harden them? Was it not <hi>Attious</hi> and <hi>Proclus</hi> love and lenity that ended that diviſion?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Did the Excommunicating of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> by <hi>Cyril,</hi> compel them to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when ſo much of the Eaſt are <hi>Neſtorians</hi> to this day, and requite the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox with their Excommunications?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Did the Excommunicating of thoſe that rejected the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> (the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Acephali</hi>) compel them to <hi>Obedience,</hi> when many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors took their part, and the greater number of Biſhops joyned with them, and they equally damned thoſe that received the Council for many Princes Reigns.

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>COnfirmation</hi> was <hi>(at firſt)</hi> a good Invention of the Church, and <hi>politickly and wiſely</hi> ordain'd: not (in <hi>ſupplement to Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> for <hi>that</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without it) but <hi>to the end,</hi> that when Children come to the years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and have learned <hi>(in the Church-Catechiſm</hi>) what their Godfathers and Godmothers vowed and promiſed for them (as their <hi>Sureties and Pledges</hi>) 'till they came to Age, that they ſhould in their <hi>own perſons vow</hi> the ſame with their <hi>own mouth and conſent,</hi> openly before the Congregation.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>it is not a Sacrament,</hi> or neceſſary to Salvation, (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> inſinuate) for it is certain by God's Word (as ſaid in the Rubrick of (the ſaid <hi>firſt Engliſh Common-Prayer Book</hi> ſince the Reformation, made in the Reign of) <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <q>That children beeying Baptiſed (yf they depart out of this lyfe in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye) are <hi>undoubtedly ſaved:</hi>
                        </q> And this Common-Prayer Book (as is ſaid before) is declared to be compoſed by the <hi>Aid of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the Statute 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.1. And <hi>there is</hi> the Church-Catechiſm <hi>ſet down,</hi> beginning <hi>(as ours) What is your Name?</hi> And ending with theſe words—And therefore I ſay—<hi>Amen, ſo be it:</hi> But <hi>our Catechiſm</hi> is <hi>much larger,</hi> and all of it ought to be learnt <hi>by all,</hi> before they be (brought to the Biſhop to be) <hi>confirm'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And 'till <hi>they can ſay this Catechiſm,</hi> and give account of it, not <hi>(like a Parrot)</hi> hudling it over, but ſenſible, and underſtanding what they ſay, <hi>ſhall they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd</hi> by the Biſhop, who ought by himſelf (or ſuch as he ſhall appoint) Poſe them (or Appoſe them) in it; <hi>nor then neither,</hi> except they alſo bring with them <hi>one Godfather or Godmother,</hi> that every Child may have a Witneſs of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
                     <p>Nor <hi>then neither ought they to be confirm'd,</hi> except the Curate of the Pariſh where they dwell come along with them, or at <hi>leaſt ſend a Certificate</hi> in writing with his hand ſubſcribed thereunto, the Names of all ſuch Perſons within his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, as he ſhall think fit to be preſented to the Biſhop to be confirmed.</p>
                     <p>And then, if the Biſhop, upon Poſing them, find them fit, they <hi>ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> in manner as preſcrib'd in the Common-Prayer Book.</p>
                     <p>But are theſe things obſerved, or <hi>who regards them?</hi> I have been 19 or 20 years <hi>Rector</hi> of the Rectory of <hi>All-Saints</hi> in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and during that time have had <hi>three ſeveral Biſhops</hi> or Dioceſans.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gilbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> never made any <hi>Viſitation</hi> into the Countrey and over his Dioceſs <hi>to confirm</hi> any; and yet the ſame Rubrick ſays, None ſhall be admitted to the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, 'till they be confirmed <hi>(or deſire to be confirmed) which laſt words</hi> are not in the firſt Common-Prayer Book of <hi>Edw.</hi> VI.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Humphrey</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> made but two Viſitations, and in the latter never came near <hi>Harwich</hi> and that Countrey by twenty Miles, nor near <hi>Colcheſter</hi> by above eight Miles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> has alſo made two Viſitations, and conſequently Confirmations, and ſeveral of my Pariſh have been confirmed by them.</p>
                     <p>But how? I never gave a <hi>Certificate</hi> of the Names of ſuch as I thought fit and capable of Confirmation, the Queſtion was never ask'd me, nor of any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that I know of; nor Godfathers and Godmothers requir'd (as the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick enjoins) to every one that is confirm'd, nor many (if any) of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Men or Women, <hi>appos'd</hi> or pos'd by any Biſhop, or other by him appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>examine the fitneſs</hi> of them for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Nor, did I ever ſee any Biſhop ever examine any; if they did, I that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſaw it not done, and I am ſure <hi>many (if not all)</hi> were confirm'd without queſtioning the matter, or any ſuch ſaid Certificate from the Curate.</p>
                     <p>Surely, Confirmation was <hi>godlily deſign'd,</hi> but a <hi>perfunctory</hi> performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at all adventures, is quite contrary to the Inſtitution and <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But I ſay, there required no Anſwer where the Queſtion was not put, nor the Anſwer particularly requir'd of each of them.</p>
                     <p>For all that was required, (or, I am ſure of a great many) was <hi>but to kneel down,</hi> whil'ſt the Biſhop with a Common-Prayer Book <hi>in one hand,</hi> and the <hi>other hand upon the head</hi> of the perſon to be confirmed, ſaid over each of them, theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Defend (O Lord) this <hi>thy Child,</hi> (or this <hi>thy Servant, if past Infancy or Childhood)</hi> with thy heavenly grace, that he may continue thine for ever; and daily increaſe in thy holy Spirit more and more, until he come unto thy everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI's Common-Prayer Book, Confirmation was quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, and the words theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Miniſter ſigned them with the Sign of the Croſs, ſaying—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signe them,</hi> O Lord, and <hi>mark them</hi> to be thine for ever, by the vertue of thy holy Croſſe and Paſſion: confirme and ſtrengthen them with the inward Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy Holy Ghoſte, mercifully unto everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>Then the Biſhop ſhall <hi>croſs them in the forehead,</hi> and lay his hand upon their head, ſaying,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>M.</hi> or any other Name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>N. <hi>I Signe thee with the Signe of the Croſſe, and lay my hand upon thee. In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Amen.</q> But the Prayer preceding (is the very ſame with ours) obſerve it.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Almightie and everliving God, who haſt voucheſafed to</hi> regenerate theſe <hi>thy Servants of water and the Holy Ghoſt; And</hi> haſt geven unto them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geveneſſe of all their ſinnes: <hi>Sende down from Heaven we beſeeche thee, (O Lord) upon them thy Holy Goſte the Coumforter, with the manifolde giftes of Grace, the Spirite of wyſedom and underſtanding: The Spirite of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and goſtly ſtrength: The Spirite of knowledge and true godlineſſe, and fulfyll them (O Lorde) with the Spirite of thy holy feare;</hi> (but ours, adde, (onely) now and for ever.</q>
                     <p>And then this Collect following, is almoſt the ſame with that of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. I'll ſet down only part of it, namely—
<q>
                           <hi>Almightie everliving God, whiche makeſt us bothe to will and to doe thoſe thinges that be good and acceptable unto thy Majeſtie; we make our humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications unto thee for theſe Children, upon whome (after the xample of thy holy Apoſtles) we have layd our hands,</hi> (mark that, for it is the ſame in our Common-Prayer Book) <hi>to certifye them (by this Signe) of thy ſavour and gracious goodnes towarde them: leat thy fatherly hande,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know, a Biſhop being a great perſon, may <hi>(as Majeſty uſes to do)</hi> when he means only his own ſingle act, and ſingle hand, ſay <hi>we, we;</hi> for ſo it is ſaid—<hi>we</hi> have laid <hi>our hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, how theſe words—<hi>our hands,</hi> can be meant of the Biſhop's laying on his <hi>ſingle hand,</hi> and but one hand, cannot be reconciled to any Grammar:</p>
                     <p>For in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI's Reign, the happy Reformers kept up—Impoſition of hands <hi>(not hand)</hi> (as the Collect aforeſaid ſays) after the example of the holy Apoſtles, and in imitation of the Apoſtles; laying on of <hi>their hands</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52560:38"/>upon the Diſciples, and thereby conveying to them the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Papiſts anoint, or have an Unction, in meer Mimickry or Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Unction of the Holy Ghoſt; which was not ſold or made of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary Drugs, (as the Papiſts Unction is) but purely ſpiritual gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, the gift of Tongues, diſcerning of Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they that would fain be accounted <hi>Succeſſors of the Apoſtles,</hi> and of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and love to be called—the <hi>Apoſtolical men,</hi> would make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to be performed, or (of right ought) to be performed by <hi>Biſhops onely,</hi> (who the Papiſts account to be) the onely Apoſtolical men, and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the ſmall Prophets or Apoſtles, St. <hi>Matthew, Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the Pope,</hi> the onely Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our firſt Reformers did not confine this Act of Confirmation to a <hi>Biſhop (alone)</hi> but to other his Fellow Presbyters, who ſigned with the Croſs, and ſaid as many words over the head of the Child, as the Biſhop himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus when <hi>John</hi> was preſent, <hi>Peter</hi> did not bid him <hi>ſtand aſide,</hi> but both of them together laid <hi>their hands</hi> upon the young Converts, and they received the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; in imitation whereof, Confirmation was brought in.</p>
                     <p>And the Rubrick, makes the Curate or his Certificate a neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that of (King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.) the firſt Reformers, the Miniſter laid his hands on, or at leaſt, <hi>ſigned the Party</hi> with the ſign of the Croſs, and ſaid words over him; or; prayed over him.</p>
                     <p>And probably alſo (as is uſual in Ordination) both laid their hands on; or elſe, what Engliſh or Senſe is in thoſe words in the Collect—<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom we have laid our hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now (I ſay) the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> without the concurrence or conſent of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Pariſh (who beſt knows the ſtate of the Flock) <hi>alone confirms</hi> all that come; which are <hi>very few</hi> (God knows) not one (in a hundred, or more) that are baptized;</p>
                     <p>And thoſe, or moſt of them, <hi>hand over-head,</hi> without any previous examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fitneſs:</p>
                     <p>And therefore who can pray in Faith, or believe what he ſays and prays, as aforeſaid, in theſe words—God, who haſt vouchſafed to <hi>Regenerate</hi> theſe thy Servants by water, and the Holy Ghoſt; (<hi>and yet for ought he knows</hi> (I am ſure of ſome) <hi>were never baptized ſo much as by water; over whom</hi> (yet) <hi>he prays, or ought to pray, in theſe words, and then</hi>—) and haſt given unto them forgiveneſs of all their ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle:) But what extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy will not men run into, that would graſp all to themſelves, contrary to the proviſion the Law has made for the Miniſter's conſent and concurrence (at leaſt) to this ſame Confirmation; to his actual laying on of Hands (as well as the Biſhops) in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI's time, and ſigning with the Croſs (as well as the Biſhop) and praying over their heads, part of that Prayer that now the Biſhop will ſay alone; but in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI's Common-Prayer Book, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaid alone, before the Biſhop toucht the Party to be confirmed.</p>
                     <p>So that Confirmation, <hi>without previous</hi> examination and fitneſs; <hi>without God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father</hi> or <hi>Godmother</hi> for a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and without the <hi>Curate's preſenting</hi> thoſe of his Pariſh to be confirmed, and <hi>certifying their fitneſs,</hi> is not only raſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory, impertinent and contrary to the great deſign thoſe had that invented it, but is alſo <hi>illegal, and againſt Law,</hi> and the Act for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereafter I may, perhaps, ſhew at large, when and by whom it was invented; but this for the preſent, I am clear for the uſe of it according to Law, but the abuſe of it is abominable.</p>
                     <p>I write this for the obſervation of the Law, and that ſuch as cry down <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> and call for Gaols, Stocks, Fines, Excommunications, Suſpenſions, Deprivations, and Confiſcations, may learn Forbearance, Mercy, <hi>Humanity</hi> and Kindneſs <hi>to humane kind,</hi> conſidering humane frailty ſo viſible in themſelves; and may not with the ſame mouth opened againſt <hi>other Nonconformiſts,</hi> at the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52560:39"/>ſame time, <hi>pronounce</hi> their <hi>own doom,</hi> and deprivation of their ſpiritual <hi>Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that are worth the keeping and tugging for.</p>
                     <p>And may <hi>learn to be quiet,</hi> and bleſs Almighty God, that they are <hi>ſo well on't</hi> themſelves, and never <hi>Vex themſelves to vex others,</hi> breathing out nothing but miſchief and ruine, to ſuch as are loth to <hi>unman themſelves</hi> by ſervile Baſeneſs, Flattery and Sycophantry.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I would much rather ceaſe to be a Clergyman, than ceaſe to be an Honeſt man, an Engliſhman, and a Gentleman:</p>
                     <p>Which ne'r a <hi>Flattering Pimp</hi> and <hi>Sycophant</hi> in <hi>England</hi> can poſſibly be.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, <hi>Confirmation</hi> is either <hi>good for ſomething,</hi> or <hi>good for nothing;</hi> either <hi>good, fit</hi> and <hi>expedient,</hi> or <hi>not expedient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be not expedient, Why is it put into the Common-Prayer Book, or ſo much as (once) perfunctorily practis'd?</p>
                     <p>If it be good for ſomething <hi>(which I readily grant)</hi> then why is it not us'd, but abus'd?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why is it ever us'd by a Biſhop, <hi>raſhly,</hi> hand over-head, <hi>Hickletee-Pickletee,</hi> to all <hi>that kneel down,</hi> whether baptiz'd, or unbaptiz'd; whether they <hi>can, or cannot ſay</hi> their Catechiſm; whether they have Godfathers and Godmothers, along with them, or though they <hi>never had any ſuch Godfathers or Sureties,</hi> but tell Stories, when they ſay—<hi>They did promiſe and vow three things in my name, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Catechiſm: And <hi>not one word</hi> of all the <hi>three</hi> is true, or was ever promis'd or vow'd by any body, no, not by their own Parents, who, one would think, ought to be moſt concern'd both in the Vow and Performance?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Why does not the Biſhop require the <hi>Significavit</hi> from the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter,</hi> of the Truth of the Premiſes, and the fitneſs of thoſe that are to be confirmed; but this 'tis to do <hi>all alone,</hi> what is <hi>impoſſible to be well done by any one man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Why does not the Biſhop go to <hi>all the Pariſhes</hi> in his Dioceſs, to <hi>confirm the Souls that are therein?</hi> It is his work, and he is <hi>well paid</hi> for the ſame. And why <hi>onely,</hi> at a <hi>great Town, two or three,</hi> where there is a <hi>great Inn,</hi> and <hi>good Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?</hi> I am confident St. <hi>Paul</hi> never ſent his Harbinger before him, (when he went to viſit <hi>the Brethren, and ſee how they did;</hi> and by <hi>Preaching, confirmed or ſtrengthned the Souls</hi> of the young Converts;) or, when his Harbinger return'd with ſad News of cold comfort and accommodation, ſtopt his Coach, and fac't about to the next good Town.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is not the <hi>Souls of Villagers</hi> and <hi>Countrey-Folk,</hi> as dear to God, and <hi>(ought to be as dear)</hi> to a Biſhop, as thoſe of the <hi>Citizens</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> of good Trade and Accommodation?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If <hi>Confirmation</hi> be <hi>onely a Biſhop's work,</hi> and alſo a <hi>needful</hi> work, (as the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> ſeems to ſay) then why is not <hi>Confirmation</hi> the <hi>Biſhop's daily work,</hi> if the People <hi>want ſuch daily bread?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Unconfirmed Perſons and Children (in <hi>London, Westminſter,</hi> and <hi>Lines of Communication</hi>) cannot poſſibly by <hi>one Biſhop</hi> be confirmed in <hi>Twenty Years,</hi> (though he <hi>do nothing elſe,</hi> every day in the week, without reſting the Sabbath) although he confirmed <hi>Forty every day;</hi> which are as many as he can well examine, (as the Law and Reaſon admoniſhes they ought to be examin'd) though both his Chaplains were his <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> in ſo ſolemn and grand Inqueſt, on which the receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper does depend; and to which ſuch ſerious and previous Precaution is ſo neceſſarily requiſite.</p>
                     <p>And by that time the Biſhop and his Chaplains have ſpent twenty years in ſo good a work, they had need begin <hi>their Circuit again,</hi> for in thoſe 20 years, <hi>a new Generation</hi> will ariſe, that will need their helping hand as much as the former, and ſo for ever would the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> be employ'd in <hi>London onely;</hi> and then what would become of three Counties more, <hi>Eſſex, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire?</hi> How ſhould <hi>we in the Countrey</hi> make ſhift without <hi>Viſitations, Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Confirmations, Institutions, Inductions, Conſecrations</hi> and <hi>Ordinations;</hi> for which the Biſhop <hi>could ſpare no time,</hi> if he have his hands full of Little <hi>London</hi> onely? Wherein are more Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, than were in a thouſand Biſhopricks in the Primitive Times?</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52560:39"/> 6. If <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>previous examination</hi> and capacity be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, (as the Rubrick aſſerts and enjoins) then will not greater Inconveniences neceſſarily follow? Namely, either making <hi>Dioceſſes leſs,</hi> and after the Primitive Mode, and like the Primitive Chriſtians, (when no Biſhop had above one Altar, nor more of his Dioceſs than his Chancel and Church would well hold:) as is ſufficiently and undeniably prov'd by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy: a Pariſh and a Dioceſs ſignifying one and the ſame thing, and ſome (one) of our Pariſhes (as <hi>Stepney, St. Martins, St. Gyles</hi>'s, <hi>St. Andrews Holborn,</hi> &amp;c. the leaſt whereof) would make an Hundred Primitive Dioceſſes; nay, it is well if an Hundred Biſhops could look well after one of them Pariſhes, as they ought to be look'd after. Four hundred years after Chriſt, in <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time, at a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference Provincial,</hi> there were 286 Biſhops, and 120 abſent, and 60 Sees vacant, 486 Biſhops in one Province. Or elſe, if the Dioceſſes continue ſo <hi>vaſt,</hi> then <hi>Suffragan-Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> muſt neceſſarily come <hi>into Play again,</hi> or elſe <hi>Confirmation</hi> (muſt either <hi>not be done,</hi> or <hi>not done as it ought,</hi> and as is required by the Statute to be done;) impoſſible to be done throughout a whole Dioceſs <hi>by any one man</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in ſuch manner as the Law enacts.</p>
                     <p>So that neceſſarily either the <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> muſt be made leſs, or my <hi>Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> (by <hi>Biſhop-Suffragans</hi>) augmented in Number, or elſe <hi>Confirmation</hi> taken out of the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> or at leaſt altered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>'Tis a Fable</hi> to ſay, That <hi>Atlas</hi> (alone) bore up the Heavenly Globe <hi>on his ſingle Shoulders,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Burden too great</hi> for any individual mortal man; and ſo is the Office of a <hi>Dioceſan-Biſhop</hi> at this day, except his work be made leſs, or his Helps in Government more and greater.</p>
                     <p>By Helps in Government, I do not mean <hi>Excommunicating Helps</hi> in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lay-Chancellors, Doctors, Proctors, Regiſters, Vice-Regiſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Saving Helps,</hi> and <hi>Confirming Helps, Chorepiſcopi, Suffragan-Biſhops;</hi> a word <hi>no</hi> (Nuſance, nor a) <hi>ſtranger</hi> to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>But will that old Remedy of <hi>Suffragan-Biſhops</hi> be ever liſtned unto? What Biſhop alive will be guilty of ſo much—<hi>Self-denial,</hi> (as conſcious of his own Inability, or rather Impoſſibility, for the diſcharge of ſo great a Cure and work) as to take in Partners and Comrades to ſo high a Chair, where (ſome think) there's room little enough in all Conſcience for one Corps.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs it would ſhew <hi>great Zeal</hi> in my Lords the Biſhops, and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the celebrated <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformitn,</hi> if to ſhew their <hi>Conformity</hi> thereunto, and their Love to <hi>Epiſcopal Confirmation,</hi> they ſhould Surrogate many <hi>Suffragan Biſhops,</hi> as Coadjutors in ſo bleſſed a work; and would <hi>chronicle</hi> them, and <hi>renown</hi> them to all Poſterity, and entitule them to the <hi>great Honor</hi> of being <hi>Conformiſts</hi> in After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ages.</p>
                     <p>But ſome men <hi>do not love Honor ſo well,</hi> as to purchaſe it at ſo <hi>dear a Rate:</hi> For in all Conſcience the <hi>Suffragan-Biſhops</hi> that ſhare in the Pains, might honeſtly <hi>put in their Spoons</hi> for a Meals-meat, and ſhare in the Gains.</p>
                     <p>For that very Trick therefore, I do not expect to live to ſee ſuch a Primitive Face of the Church in this Iron Age, nor ſo much Tenderneſs and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs in the diſcharge of Duty and Self-denial in any Biſhop; but I wiſh I could ſee it. In the <hi>Interim,</hi> as I hap to meet with them, I will ſee if I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to't, becauſe the Harveſt is ſo great, and the Labourers too few, no wonder, ſo much <hi>good Corn is loſt,</hi> (amongſt the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi>) and <hi>ſhakes in the Field,</hi> for want <hi>of more hands to the work,</hi> the mighty work <hi>of Confirmation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more <hi>appoſite</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> to conclude this Eſſay, (than His Moſt Gracious Majeſties Declaration (<hi>pag.</hi> 11.) publiſhed <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1660.) to vindicate it from all appearance of Novelty; in theſe words:
<q>
                           <p>Becauſe the Dioceſſes, eſpecially ſome of them, are thought to be of too large Extent, We will appoint ſuch a Number of Suffragan Biſhops, in every Dioceſs, as ſhall be ſufficient for the due performance of their work.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No Biſhop ſhall ordain or exerciſe any part of Juriſdiction which appertaineth to the Cenſures of the Church, without the advice and aſſiſtance of the Presbyters: And no Chancellors, Commiſſaries or Officials, as ſuch, ſhall exerciſe any Act of Spiritual Juriſdiction, in theſe Caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Excommunication, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>It has been prov'd, that if a <hi>Dioceſan-Biſhop</hi> had no other work, beſides <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation only,</hi> it is impoſſible that all the Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> ſhould confirm thoſe that want Confirmation in <hi>this one only Dioceſs of</hi> London, though they did nothing elſe, and left their own Sees vacant, if they obſerve the Rubrick and Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and not do it <hi>(as is too frequent)</hi> perfunctorily, and ſhamefully, but with ſuch previous caution, ſcrutiny, examination and circumſpection, and with Certificates thereof, and Godfathers and Godmothers, as the Common-Prayer-Book enjoyns.</p>

                  <p>I'LL add but one Argument more, and 'tis the <hi>ſlendereſt</hi> in all the Artillery of Logick, but for <hi>Home-thruſts,</hi> (like a Vipers tongue, 'tis ſlender indeed, but) moſt Mortal and <hi>Irreſiſtible;</hi> 'tis called, <hi>Argumentum ad Huminem,</hi> like <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adultery, Doeſt thou commit adultery?</hi> ſo ſay I;</p>
                  <p>Thou Adulterer! Art not thou a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and Acts for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity? Is not Adultery againſt the Common-Prayer-Book? Is not an Illegal Ceremony-monger a Non-Conformiſt? Is not an Adulterer a Non-Conformiſt? Is not a Noddy, (I ſhould ſay) Nodder to the Altar, to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> a Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt? Is he ſo?</p>
                  <p>Why, then thou old formality! thou whip and ſpur! Will no pace ſerve thee but a <hi>Gallop and Tantivy,</hi> Foot and Horſe, Companies and Troops, Trot and Gallop? On what Service? What Expedition? To root a Conventicle? Have a care man, and fly, fly, get out of harms way, for fear they face about and root thee for a Non-Conformiſt, and take from thee (thy pride and joy of thy heart) thy 2, 3, 4, 5. Spiritual Promotions. Ha?</p>
                  <p>Non-Conformiſts? <hi>Is that the Word?</hi> one would think, thou ſhouldſt (for thine own ſake) hereafter be good to Non-Conformiſts, thou dull <hi>Coyner</hi> and <hi>Forger</hi> of Ceremonies, (thy chief Religion) in defiance of the Holy Acts for Uniformity!</p>
                  <p>You, that would have all Non-Conformiſts undone, Body, Soul and Eſtate, you that are all for Curſing and Impriſoning; all for filling Hell and the Gaol, come on, How do you like this deprivation for Non-Conformity? How does this <hi>Stone-doublet</hi> fit you? you that breathe nothing but Gaols, Fines, Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Suſpenſions, Hell and Excommunications, and Writs in the Rear of it.</p>
                  <p>Thou wicked and unjuſt Judg! doſt thou Sentence, or Excommunicate <hi>ſome</hi> Non-Conformiſts, and not <hi>all</hi> Non-Conformiſts? and doſt thou partially ſpare thine own Nodding, Superſtitious, ſilly ſelf? <hi>James</hi> 2.1. <hi>My Brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (nor the Laws of God and the King) <hi>the Lord of glory, with reſpect of perſons.</hi>

                  <p>Either, <hi>all</hi> being guilty, let <hi>all</hi> ſuffer; (but where ſhall we get Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?) or elſe being guilty, <hi>(As in general Mutiny)</hi> none ſuffer: Otherwiſe, James 2.3. <hi>Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then do not beſpeak Grand-Jury-men, to make <hi>fiſh of one,</hi> and <hi>fleſh of another;</hi> but either ſpare <hi>all</hi> Non-Conformiſts, or ſpare <hi>no</hi> Non-Conformiſts, ſmall nor great, Lay-man nor Clergy-man, Biſhop nor Arch-Biſhop, Dean nor Chapter, Singing-men nor Singing-boys, Regiſter nor Sumner; no, nor Juſtices, nor your ſelves, Grand-Jury-men, <hi>ſpare all or ſpare none,</hi> from the greateſt to the leaſt; from the <hi>Bench</hi> to the <hi>Bar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doſt thou ſay no Non-Conformiſts ought to be ſworn of a Jury? Ha? let me hear this again, <hi>Is this Law?</hi> That no tranſgreſſors of the Law ſhall be either Judg or Jury-man? turn thine eyes inward, look into thine own Breaſt, and then tell me, <hi>Is this Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What? Shall no tranſgreſſor of a Statute be a Judg or a Jury-man? not one Whoremaſter, Drunkard, Extortioner, nor Blaſphemer, Curſer nor Swearer? Or, is the tranſgreſſion of the Statutes for Uniformity <hi>the greateſt tranſgreſſion?</hi>

                  <p>There's no reaſon for that, but we'l admit it, rather than ſpoil good diſcourſe: and then tell me, thou ſilly Superſtitious deviſer and obſerver of Illegal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, thou <hi>Cloud</hi> that would <hi>overcaſt</hi> all Religion, Doſt thou think to eſcape the

                  <p>For where are our Lives, our Liberties, our Properties, <hi>our All</hi> by the Law, <hi>if it be Law,</hi> to have none but Conformiſts Jury-men if ever we live to ſee none but <hi>Papiſts—Conformiſts,</hi> which is not impoſſible?

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I known a <hi>willing Court,</hi> yare and ready at an Execution, right or wrong, upon a Biſhop's <hi>ſignificavit,</hi> ſend a man to Gaol, when the Biſhop (to my knowledg) granted that <hi>ſignificavit,</hi> (of one Excommunicate) and knew no more of the matter, or whether juſt, or the merit of the cauſe; <hi>(more than the Man in the Moon)</hi> but by <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> in the Regiſter, or his <hi>Eccho;</hi> I mean, Mr. <hi>Formality,</hi> called a Surrogate, or Official.</p>
                  <p>Sinner, you ought to be <hi>Excommunicate, Suſpended,</hi> (ſaith Regiſter, or Vice-Regiſter:) <hi>Excommunicetur, Suſpendatur,</hi> quoth <hi>Eccho-Surrogate.</hi> Wonderful Eccleſiaſtical-Policy, and Kirk-Diſcipline!</p>
                  <p>Is there any Wit or Grace, Law, Reaſon, Conſcience or Equity in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings?</p>
                  <p>What? Curſe men, Damn them, Gaol them, and all by Implicite Faith in a Silly, Covetous, Wretched, Extorting, Lack-Latin Regiſter? <hi>Sir, How came you by the Keys</hi> of the Church? Theſe Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and Earth? Theſe Keys that let <hi>in and out</hi> to Hell and the Gaol? <hi>Did you come honeſtly by them?</hi>—ſpeak man—How came you, Sir, to ſay, Firſt, Take him, Devil? —Secondly, and conſequently—Take him Magiſtrate?—Thirdly and laſtly, Take him Gaoler?—And in Gaol he muſt there lie and die without Bayl or Mainprize, by 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.15. <hi>How long?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52560:46"/>
                  <p> Until he firſt <hi>pleaſe,</hi> (that is, <hi>pay</hi>) this ſame extorting Regiſter, 'till, 1. He be pleas'd, and <hi>as much he pleaſes,</hi> at the <hi>will of</hi> this <hi>Lord,</hi> (or, rather Tyrant of Souls and Purſes.) 2. He muſt ſwear to obey the Ordinary, and <hi>(ſtare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandatis Eccleſiae)</hi> commandments of Holy-Church. 3. He ſhall then be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, and have a <hi>Certificavit</hi> thereof to the Biſhop, who then (in courſe) grants a <hi>Significavit,</hi> and then by Writ to the Sheriff, the poor Excommunicate gets out of <hi>Hell, and the other Hell, the Gaol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the Regiſter, the Vice-Regiſter, with <hi>Formality-Eccho,</hi> have <hi>all the Keys</hi> at their Devotion; for what the Biſhop does by <hi>Significavit</hi> of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Abſolution, delivering <hi>to and fro</hi> the Devil and the Gaol; and <hi>all that</hi> the King's-Courts conſequently do thereupon, are all by <hi>blind Implicite-Faith</hi> in the Regiſter and Eccho, all, <hi>in courſe</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>For theſe <hi>little Sell-ſouls</hi> do the feat, <hi>vulnus opemque tulit,</hi> the ſame hand again; —they Wounded you and they cure you; the Biſhop's <hi>Significavit,</hi> and the Writ <hi>de Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> are but neceſſary Conſequents, and <hi>things in Courſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, that I ſay again, it is ſafer, 1000 times ſafer to anger the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> or Great <hi>Mogull,</hi> than a ſneaking, raſcally, covetous, extorting Regiſter, or Vice-Regiſter, that buys, or hires the Sell-ſoul-place, (to my knowledg) and if he buys the Devil, he muſt ſell him.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I think, we <hi>Engliſh</hi> men are at a fine paſs, when our Souls, our Bodies, our Properties and Liberties lye at <hi>this looſe lock,</hi> whilſt a Regiſter or Sumner keeps (really and truly) <hi>the Keys</hi> of all.</p>

                     <hi>This fellow</hi> makes no more Bones of a Soul, than if it had not a Bone in it; nor knows wherefore it is delivered to Satan, or, more of the matter, or merit of the Cauſe, than the moſt Reverend <hi>Arch-Biſhop, Lord-Biſhop,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Arch-Deacon;</hi> that are miles off, and abſent, <hi>I'le depoſe for Mr.</hi> Neceſſity, he knows no Law, Civil-Law, nor Uncivil-Law; all he minds, or knows, or enquires, is only— <hi>Wher's my Gray-Groat</hi> for ſubſcribing the Anathema, or Curſe?

                  </p>
                  <p>Did no body ever hear of a Gentleman (he <hi>ſhall be nameleſs for me</hi>) that would needs have a Hat button'd up of <hi>the right ſide;</hi> but happening to put it on the wrong way, ſtamp'd and ſtar'd <hi>(like mad)</hi> at the Haberdaſher, <hi>Sirrah,</hi> quoth he, did not I ſpeak for a Hat that button'd up <hi>on the right ſide</hi> yea? quoth the Haberdaſher, but that will coſt ten ſhillings more; coſt what it will coſt, quoth Gallant, (that had more Money than Wit) I'le have it: ſo he was glad to go home and bring him the ſame Hat again, and putting it on right, all parties were pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>Or, him that beſpoke a Picture of a Horſe lying <hi>(tauveing)</hi> upon his Back, and the Painter brought it, and ſet it before him <hi>en paſſant;</hi> at which diſappointment the Gallant rav'd, 'till going home (and for more Money) he brought him the ſame Picture turn'd <hi>topſie-turvy,</hi> and ſo the fool was pleas'd.</p>

                  <p>When, God knows, the Biſhop is not ubiquitary, Can he be <hi>here, and there, and every-where?</hi> he is but a man, What would you have?

                  <p>An error in the firſt concoction (Phyſicians ſay) can never be amended in the ſecond and third; ſo here if the Official miſs the mark, the Biſhop never mends it, but ſhoots at random, lets ſly at all in Courſe, and after him; in <hi>Courſe too,</hi> the Writ <hi>follows in Courſe; Courſe-doings</hi> to be ſure, though the Sell-ſouls think 'tis <hi>very ſine.</hi>

                  <p>Did you never ſee a <hi>Grey-Hound stare</hi> when he had loſt a Hare in an unhappy Buſh, that ſtood by the way, juſt when he was, at <hi>the very clique,</hi> and gaping, to mouth her? even ſo, have I ſeen a cunning Politician ſtare, as if <hi>out of his Wits,</hi> or, at leaſt at <hi>his Wits end,</hi> when ſome ſudden croſs Providence (by him call'd <hi>ſtrange acciden</hi>) has given his <hi>Devilſhip the go-by:</hi> then, then, to ſee him ſtare and ſtamp, fret and curſe, rave and roar (like a Lyon in a Graté) that would be mouthing, but for the Barriers.</p>
                  <p>Go, then, you ſubtile Perſecutors! fret, and be molt in your own fat, and live (like the <hi>Green-land Bears</hi> in Winter) upon your own Greaſe, as long as it laſts, whilſt,

                  <p>Well, this I'le ſay for the Pope, and <hi>a fig for him,</hi> (but we ought to give the Devil his due, much more the Arch-Biſhop of all Biſhops) the <hi>Pope,</hi> I ſay, give him his due, builds the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy rationally,</hi> if his <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> were <hi>true:</hi> But <hi>Proteſtants do not,</hi> that conſeſs themſelves and their Churches <hi>fallible</hi> and <hi>frail,</hi> as does the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her 19th Article of the 39.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>what non-ſence</hi> is it for any Man or Church to Curſe and Damn a Man for a <hi>Heretick,</hi> when we confeſs our ſelves that we are <hi>fallible,</hi> and conſequently <hi>may err</hi> in our Judgment of the Man or his Faith? <hi>Shall blind men ſhoot a Crow?</hi> I hate this <hi>Hitty-miſſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas the <hi>Pope,</hi> grant him this <hi>Theoreme,</hi> (that he and his Church <hi>is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>) is in the right on't, let him Curſe who he will, and from Morning to Night, for ever and aye; for, if he be infallible, he only can draw this Sword of the Lord <hi>(Excommunication)</hi> and yet be ſecure that he fights not againſt God, which Proteſtants (that confeſs they may <hi>err</hi> even in matters of <hi>faith</hi>) can never be ſure of.</p>
                  <p>'Till <hi>the Church</hi> then can get eyes to <hi>ſee and diſcern</hi> right from wrong infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and a Sinner from a Saint, and a Believer from an Infidel, and Truth from Falſhood (indiſputably and not <hi>fallibly and uncertainly</hi>) let them down on their knees and pray for the Converſion of one whom they judg an Infidel, and then leave him, to his Maker, to ſtand and fall, and pray to God to tye up their hands to the <hi>good Behaviour,</hi> to Charity, Meekneſs and Humility (wherein they can <hi>never err</hi>) which would <hi>well become them,</hi> better than all this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical-Artillery,</hi> (which has ruin'd Chriſtendom) and rather let them <hi>break,</hi> than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this <hi>Money-Trade,</hi> and Merchandize of Souls, eſpecially in this her weak and <hi>Militant</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>How have the Churches, the Councils, the Fathers, the Canons Claſh't and Thwarted, Curſt and Condemn'd one another to the <hi>Pit of Hell?</hi> it would make a man's <hi>heart ake</hi> to read Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories; and to hear the pious Biſhops complain that they never knew any good come of any Convocation of Biſhops, Councils, nor Synod-men: and one Guelt himſelf, to make himſelf Canonically uncapable of <hi>Lawn-Sleeves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How did the whole Chriſtian World (who were all <hi>Arrians,</hi> and deny'd the Divinity of our Bleſſed Saviour) Curſe that poor ſingle <hi>Non-Conformist Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> (Nick-naming him) <hi>Sathanaſius?</hi> Baniſh't him, and Suborn'd falſe Witneſſes againſt him, and try'd him for his Life for Murder? whilſt on the contrary, our Church of <hi>England</hi> declares that no man can be ſaved that does not believe all the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and the Comment (in words of his own, not in Scripture-words) of the Holy and Sacred Trinity, made by him. Though a man does believe the Holy Trinity declar'd in Scripture, yet, <hi>if he will be ſaved,</hi> he muſt believe all the <hi>Athanaſian-Creed.</hi> I do not know any man that does not believe it.</p>
                  <p>But, all the Common-Prayer-Books in the World, and all the Acts for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, nor all the Kings and Parliaments in the World, can never make any thing <hi>true</hi> that is <hi>really falſe;</hi> nor make any <hi>thing falſe,</hi> which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plainly ſays to be <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As, for example, ſuppoſe there be ſome miſtakes in the Common-Prayer-Book, by falſe Printing, or, in the Table to find <hi>Easter</hi> for ever, yet it is Statute-Law.</p>
                  <p>But that cannot make a thing true, which is <hi>Mathematically falſe;</hi> nor can any Statute make a Child of God a Child of the Devil, though Anathematiz'd for a Heretick.</p>
                  <p>And how good Biſhops have bewail'd the <hi>Dioceſan-frame</hi> in our days, ſee pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Confeſſion of the Corruptions in Church-Governours and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>(I am not ſingular)</hi> in his <hi>Modeſt Offer and Peace-maker:</hi> See the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably

                     <q>I neither approve or excuſe the Perſonal faults of any particular Biſhops, as to their exerciſe of their Power and Authority; which ought not in weighty matters to be managed without the Preſence, Counſel, and Suffrages of the Presbyters, ſuch as are fit for that Aſſiſtance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I have done, at the long run, with my Naked Truth, expos'd to the World, without Power, without Friends, without Worldly Intereſt to ſupport it. It is uſually thus, thoſe that <hi>worſt may,</hi> are often put <hi>to hold the Candle</hi> to their betters; yet, like <hi>Link-boys,</hi> many times get not of the Gallants, <hi>but a kick</hi> for their pains.</p>

                  <p>WE live in an Age wherein ſome men are grown <hi>Libertines;</hi> and ſince the Diſſolution of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſome are grown ſo wonderful light and wanton, that they <hi>kick up their Heels</hi> at all Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and defie a Parliament with as much courage as they defie God and the Day of Judgment, when they cry <hi>God-damn-me.</hi>

                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> came into the <hi>Hall</hi> at <hi>Doctors Commons, June</hi> 8. 1681. He went up to the Doctors, Habited in their <hi>Formalities,</hi> and with their Caps on, and he alſo put on his Hat; which Sir <hi>Robert Wiſeman</hi> no ſooner eſpyed, but he bid <hi>Mr. Hickeringill</hi> be uncovered: But <hi>Mr. Hicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingill</hi> replyed to him in Greek, and to all Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Repartees; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed for a conſiderable time: <hi>Mr. Hickeringill</hi> diſcourſed ſtill in Greek; at length Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s patience being ſpent, (and none of the Doctors would find any more Greek to anſwer <hi>Mr. Hickeringil</hi> than Sir <hi>Robert</hi> did), it was ordered, that this appearance, and Anſwer in Greek, only ſhould be Regiſtred as a Non-appearance: Wherefore then <hi>Mr. Hickeringill</hi> did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52560:50"/>in Engliſh that he had ſaid in Greek; telling Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> that he firſt demanded to ſee or hear their Commiſſion and Authority for citing him thus from his Family and Home, and out of the Dioceſs where he dwells, contrary to 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.9. And that till it did appear to him that this was his Majeſties Court Eccleſiaſtical, he would pay no reſpect to it, nor be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered before men that were all (except Sir <hi>Robert</hi>) his Juniors at the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, and moſt of them very much his Inferiors in many other reſpects, not ſuitable to his modeſty there to particularize; Degrees (ſo eaſily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd) and empty Titles being admir'd by none but Women and Fools. Whereupon, inſtead of ſhewing a Commiſſion, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> again bid him be uncovered, which ſtill he refuſed: Then Sir <hi>Robert</hi> made ſigns to an old Fellow, a kind of Sumner, to come behind <hi>Mr. Hickeringill</hi> and ſnatch his Hat off, which he did; but Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> forthwith ſnatcht his Hat from the ſaid Fellow, and clapt it faſt upon his Head. and there kept it during his ſtay there; throwing amongſt them a Proteſtation (which was read in Court) and to this effect.</p>

                     <hi>An Eſſay concerning Sequeſtrations, by</hi> Edm. Hickeringill.</head>
                  <p>IF ever any <hi>Rags of Popery</hi> remain in a Proteſtant Conſtitution and Government, (ſome think) that <hi>old Popiſh Invention</hi> called <hi>Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will ſtill ſtand up and plead for its ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> is a term of Art well known in the late Times, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Lands in controverſie or diſpute, or in Abeyance, or <hi>in nubibus,</hi> are put into the hands of an indifferent perſon or perſons to retain the rents and profits, or take them into cuſtody, till the controverſie be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and till there be a lawful Incumbent (by Inſtitution and Induction); or, if a Donative, until the Patron do beſtow the ſame upon a Clergy-man.</p>
                  <p>Sequeſtration is a <hi>Roman</hi> word, and honeſt enough, if it had not been ſo often abus'd; and where Arbitrary Government (as in the late times) comes in faſhion, it is of uſe, of wicked uſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Silent leges inter arma,</hi> we muſt not talk of Laws, of the ancient and fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> when either War, Force, Popery (or its Twin) Arbitrary Government, comes into play, and is on the winning-hand.</p>
                  <p>The Pope <hi>had a Trick of old,</hi> when any Biſhoprick or good Living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>vacant,</hi> it <hi>ſhould go hard</hi> but he would have a <hi>ſnip out of it,</hi> before he put in a new Incumbent; and this taking the Benefits into his own hand, he called <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> (that is) keeping the profits in an indifferent hand, to be ready for the next lawful Incumbent, having ſome reſpect in the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> in making ſome proviſion for the Cure, anſwerable to the profits of the vacant Benefice.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the Pope, have (of old) had many a <hi>ſhrowd and weary Tugg</hi> for the Profits in the Vacancies of Biſhopricks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and his <hi>own</hi> Daughter Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> (that <hi>ſet the Pope at Defiance</hi>) made bold to keep the Profits of the <hi>vacant</hi> Biſhopricks in their own hands; <hi>(right and good reaſon),</hi> for by 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.1. the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are declared the ſole &amp; only founders of Biſhopricks, and Archbiſhopricks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as other great men of the Realm, and Lords of Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pariſh-Churches; and therefore the cuſtody of the Profits of the <hi>Benefice</hi> (in the Vacation) belongs to the <hi>Patrons,</hi> and of the vacant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks to the <hi>King</hi> (and not to the Biſhops) by 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1350, and by the Statute of <hi>Carliſle</hi> 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p>How comes the Pope then, and Biſhops, to be ſo buſie in ſending out Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations in every Vacancy? why, ſome men love to be doing, if it be but at ſmall games <hi>(they'l play)</hi> rather than ſtick out; and ſend out Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations, if but for the fee ſake; <hi>come, come,</hi> ſomething has ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For ſome men dare in defiance of the ſaid Statute, take upon them to Sequeſter the Profits of vacant Benefices, which the ſaid Statutes do aver to belong to the Patrons, in theſe very words 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Kings, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, as Lords and Advowees, have had and ought to have the cuſtody of ſuch voidances. Beſides, men that love to be dabling, and have an Oar in every Boat, they think there is ſome ſport in caſting the Net, though it does not always bring ſtore of Fiſh in't.</p>
                  <p>But a main reaſon certainly is, That they cannot endure to hear that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Profits ſhould come <hi>into</hi> (though they came <hi>out of) Lay-fingers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore a <hi>heavy-do they kept</hi> (the Biſhops) with Q. <hi>Eliz</hi> for keeping
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52560:52"/>the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ely</hi> ſo long vacant, and ſequeſtring all the ſtately Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Rents, Revenues (one of the beſt in <hi>England</hi> at that time) and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the moneys thereof, (as at this day) into (a place that often needs the ſame) the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Putting off the fretting-Biſhops with a Complement, namely that ſhe kept the ſaid ſtately and rich Biſhoprick vacant ſo long (as only) till ſhe could find a man <hi>fit</hi> for it. And the man that <hi>fitted her pretenſions</hi> (that is) would be content to part with the ſaid rich Lordſhips, Rents and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and <hi>in lieu thereof</hi> take a Penſion, was <hi>the man</hi> for her purpoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning all to the Crown, (from whence they came, and that chang'd the rich Abbey of <hi>Ely</hi> into a <hi>Biſhops-See,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1.) and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, contented with a yearly Penſion out of the ſaid Exchequer in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money when he gets it.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. kept the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by Sequeſtration, from the death of <hi>Anſelm</hi> (five years) till <hi>Rodolph</hi> (a man for his turn) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; that <hi>Rodolph</hi> that would not conſecrate <hi>Thurſtan</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> except he would ſwear obedience to him in the <hi>See of Canterbury: Thurſtan</hi> ſcorn'd <hi>the motion,</hi> and the Pope took part with <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> and bid him <hi>not yield an inch;</hi> but <hi>Rodolph</hi> endeavour'd to be above him, and the King took part with <hi>Rodolph,</hi> but to <hi>no purpoſe;</hi> for the King was glad (at length) to connive and <hi>ſubmit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, that I'le ſay for the Clergy in Popiſh times, and foppiſh times, they ſhall <hi>juſtle</hi> for the place, and <hi>buſtle</hi> for profit (where there's any to be got) as well as the beſt carnal Lay-man of them all.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>true reaſon</hi> (in Law) why the King, Nobles, Patrons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to have this Priviledg (which the Pope and Biſhops have long uſurpt), is (ſaith my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>) becauſe the King is <hi>ſole founder</hi> of Biſhopricks,
<note place="margin">Inſtit. 1 Part, p. 344.</note> and Patron of Benefices; and at this day, all Donatives (which the King creates) ſhall (for this reaſon) be viſited by the Chancellor (not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop nor Arch-deacon.) And if the King licenſe a ſubject to erect and found a Church or Chappel, it is to be viſited by the <hi>founder only,</hi> not by the Biſhops; And by parity of reaſon, the Churches and Chappels of diſſolved Monaſteries are to be viſited by the owners only, that bought and paid for them. And for like reaſon Kings of <hi>England</hi> (before the Pope's Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) (as ſole owners and founders of Biſhopricks) did deliver to the Biſhop-Elect the <hi>Croſier</hi> or Paſtoral ſtaff, and the Ring, whereby there <hi>was a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> made betwixt him and his Church-Cathedral, or Mother-Church. And K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bak.</hi> Chron.</note> (being requeſted by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to make the Biſhopricks Elective) refuſed; but King <hi>John</hi> was glad to part with this choice flower of the Crown to preſerve the Crown its ſelf; of which otherwiſe that Biſhop had made bold to deprive him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, at this day the Biſhops are (in effect) the <hi>Kings creatures,</hi> I mean <hi>of his creation</hi> only, and the Election (by the <hi>Chapter,</hi> &amp;c.) is but <hi>meer form;</hi> but ſtill the <hi>Chapter</hi> (at this day) does not part with this <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;</hi> as neither with their <hi>grants of Sequeſtrations,</hi> Licenſes to Preach, Eccleſiaſtical Court-keeping, demand of Synodals, Procurations, exacting Fees and Oaths from Churchwardens, (unconſcionable Oaths <hi>like the &amp;c.

                  <p>One would think the Pope might be ſatisfied with St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony</hi> (as big and rich as all <hi>England</hi>) in <hi>Italy,</hi> at leaſt with thoſe many happy obventions for Indulgences, Jubilees, Miracles, Canonizations, Annates,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52560:53"/>Inſtallations, Penſions, Conſecrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not (as he does) claim and get the <hi>firſt-fruits alſo,</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> of every Benefice in Popedom.</p>
